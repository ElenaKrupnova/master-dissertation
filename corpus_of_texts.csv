158,The 2021 Social Survey Austria took a closer look at these questions and more.,
159,"This study is one of Austria’s largest social science projects, involving researchers at the Johannes Kepler University Linz (Department of Empirical Social Research) as well as from universities in Graz, Salzburg and Vienna.",
160,"Conducted since 1986, this is the sixth edition of the Social Survey Austria.",
161,Social Inequality JKU Prof. Johann Bacher and JKU researcher Martina Beham-Rabanser’s contribution explored the next generation and whether or not the situation in Austria is still conducive to helping the new generation to be better off than the generation before.,
162,"In other words, will the next generation  have it better than their parents\ generation, or are we already in a state of social decline?",
163,Their analyses show that social immobility has increased since the 80s.,
164,"In 1986, 48% said they experienced more upward mobility as compared to their parents, however in 2021, only 40% of those surveyed indicated they experienced upward mobility.",
165,"When it comes to men, the reason seems to be on account of fewer advancement opportunities.",
166,"When it comes to women, the reason seems to be on account of a decline in social relegation.",
167,"There is, however, no evidence that we are living in an age of social decline.",
168,"Expectations for the Future JKU researchers Dimitri Prandner and Robert Moosbrugger studied Austrians’ future expectations and surprisingly, they found that on the whole, the pandemic changed Austrians’ future expectations only marginally.",
169,"The proportion of pessimists in 2018 was 14%, just one percentage point lower than in 2021 when 15% of those surveyed were identified as pessimists.",
170,"However, the study also showed far more dramatic trends among groups of people hit particularly hard by the pandemic.",
171,"During the pandemic, families with children up to age 14 (in 2018: 27%; in 2021: 38%), those in moderate health (in 2018: 28%; in 2021: 34%) and those who have had difficulty making ends meet in lieu of income (in 2018: 25%; in 2021: 36%), have become increasingly pessimistic about the future in Austria.",
172,"In summary, most of those increasingly affected by the pandemic have lost faith, confidence, and trust in society - with dramatic consequences for society as a whole.",

201,I believe that all JKU students will benefit from the new app.,
202,"As student representatives, this is very important to us.",
203,And the journey has just begun!,
204,"Thanks to constructive feedback during the beta testing and initial pilot phases, there are a number of new ideas in the works!",
205,"At the beginning of March, selected students took part in a workshop where they discussed a number of issues in detail, including implementing new features in regard to class schedules and timetables.",
206,A major update is expected to be released as early as this summer.,
207,"Peter Brandstetter, head of the Office of Student Information and Academic Advising Services and a project supporter from the start with his many years of expertise, added, If, in the long term, we succeed in eventually offering a study planner in the myJKU app that can proactively provide students with advice and information on how to organize their studies and take all of the mandatory and elective courses and subjects, a long-standing dream will have come true!",
208,"It remains exciting and suspenseful, to say the least!
",
209,The antiviral is also effective against all known coronaviruses and influenza.,
210,Spike Protein,
211,"A new paper titled: Ein auf molekularer Ebene entwickeltes Breitspektrum-Anticoronavirus-2-Lektin hemmt die Infektion mit SARS-CoV-2 und MERS-CoV in Vivo in the prestigious journal, Cell Reports Medicine, describes just how H84T-BanLec is effective against all known human-infecting coronaviruses, including MERS, the original SARS, and SARS-CoV2, including the Omicron variant.",
212,H84T-BanLec is extracted from a lectin (a carbohydrate-binding protein) isolated in bananas and molecularly engineered.,
213,"The protein produces its antiviral activity by binding to mannose-rich glycans, polysaccharides that are found on the surface of viruses but very rarely on normal healthy human cells.",
214,"Once bound, the virus can no longer infiltrate and infect the cells.",
215,"As part of this study - and together with clinical institutes at the universities in Michigan and Hong Kong - a team led by Yoo Jin Oh and Peter Hinterdorfer (Institute of Biophysics at the Johannes Kepler University Linz) conducted comprehensive structural and biophysical single-molecule studies using atomic force microscope imaging to reveal the interactive dynamics and binding properties between H84T-BanLec and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mapping the binding sites with unprecedented resolution.",
216,"As the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is highly flexible, strong and diverse, binding allows for maximal binding with H84T-BanLec, thereby producing the resulting antiviral effects.",
217,Modeling and experimental data suggest there is a network of oligomannosidic glycans in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to H84T-Ban-Lec.,
218,This strong dynamic binding of H84T-BanLec with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein explains why it is difficult for a coronavirus to resist the lectin.,
219,"Despite their antiviral potential, lectins have been previously avoided as a potential treatment because the proteins could potentially negatively affect the immune system.",
220,"H84T-BanLec, however, has been modified to negate this effect and animals have not demonstrated any adverse effects.",
221,"While there are currently several options to treat COVID-19, including remdesivir, paxlovide, and monoclonal antibodies, they vary in effectiveness, side effects, simplicity of use, and many have been shown to be less effective as SARS-CoV2 continues to evolve.",
222,"According to the research team, H84T-BanLec is particularly promising because it is effective against all of the coronavirus variants as well as influenza viruses.",
223,The researchers hope this treatment can successfully transition from animal testing to human trials.,
224,The team believes a nasal spray or drops can be used to prevent or treat coronavirus and influenza infections during flu season or in a pandemic situation.,
225,"Future plans include exploring the use of H84T-BanLec against cancer since cancer cells, like viruses, also have high surface levels of mannose glycans.
",
226,AOS is a special type of imaging technique that can suppress strong occlusion and make hidden targets visible in real time.,
227,"Drohne, Credit: JKU AOS is a sophisticated imaging method that can be used in real-time to suppress occlusion (meaning, for example, a canopy of leaves in the forest) from the aerial drone images and scientists at the JKU have recently made cutting-edge advances.",
228,AOS captures multiple images in the air at different positions.,
229,"To remove occlusion, these images are computationally combined, suppressing the occlusion and making hidden targets visible in the image.",
230,"Potential AOS applications include monitoring wildlife, conducting search and rescue missions in densely forested areas, and detecting forest fires and fire hotspots.",
231,"Up to now, the only problem with the system is that it could only be used on stationary objects.",
232,"Missing people and wild game are often in constant motion and even when using AOS, the level of technology at the time was unable to detect - much less track - these types of moving objects because sequentially capturing the individual images needed to calculate the projected forest path was taking much longer than the person, animal, or vehicle was moving.",
233,"Fast-moving objects in particular were lost in the resulting images on account of motion blur, similar to long exposure time.",
234,The JKU Institute of Computer Graphics (headed by Prof. Oliver Bimber) and the Institute of Lightweight Structures (headed by Prof. Martin Schagerl) have worked together to develop a new drone prototype.,
235,"The prototype is a global first and can detect objects moving under densely forested areas, tracking these objects in real-time.",
236,"Despite international efforts over the past several years to move in this direction, through-foilage tracking under realistic conditions was largely considered an unsolvable issue.",
237,The drone prototype’s show-stopper is a nearly10-meter long extension made out of carbon and equipped with 10 light-weight cameras aligned to able to simultaneously capture images.,
238,"The computational combination of images via the extension’s large synthetic aperture enables the occlusion to be calculated away at camera-shot speed, meaning in real-time.",
239,Initial experiments show that a color anomaly detector can detect and track people in densely covered areas of forest.,
240,"The project’s initial findings have now been published in the Science Partner Journal of Remote Sensing showing that not only is through-foilage tracking realistically possible, but also that AOS has significantly improved anomaly detection, which is often used to support automated image searching during search & rescue missions.

241,JKU researchers at the School of Education conducted a study at Austria’s schools to study the use and acceptance of educational technologies.,
242,Child using an iPad; photo credit:,
243,"Pixabay The studys target group consisted of math educators currently teaching a class during this school year at middle schools, and at general secondary schools (AHS), equipped with digital devices as outlined by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science & Research’s (BMBWF) 8-Point Plan.",
244,"Over 1,200 secondary level 1 math teachers took part in the nationwide study.",
245,", The study’s key findings: The most widely used devices are the iPad (approximately 35% of teachers use this particular technology), and Windows Notebook (approximately 40% of teachers use this technology).",
246,"Robert Weinhandl, head of the study at the JKUs School of Education, remarked: It is particularly interesting that a majority of math teachers think that digital devices are useful tools and that using them makes teaching easier.]
",
247,"A recent JKU study is shedding light on the formation of aortic aneurysms, a pathological dilatation of the aorta.",
248,Prof. David Bernhard An aortic aneurysm is a pathological aorta enlargement that can result in tearing or rupturing the aorta.,
249,It is often life-threatening.,
250,"The condition is symptomless, often going undiagnosed until it becomes very advanced and requires surgical intervention.",
251,Univ.,
252,"Prof. David Bernhard, Dr. Christian Doppler (both from the Department of Pathophysiology, Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, at the JKU’s Faculty of Medicine), along with their team, have been able to learn more about the condition to detect it early and provide individual treatment.",
253,One distinctive feature of this condition is that its onset is often associated with a particular aortic valve morphology.,
254,"A normal aortic valve is tricuspid, meaning it has three valve leaflets.",
255,"However, 2% of the population has a bicuspid aortic valve, meaning there are only two valve leaflets.",
256,"While this bicuspid condition is not pathological per se, up to 80% of those affected will develop an aortic aneurysm during their lifetime.",
257,"To date, experts still do not fully know why the condition develops.",
258,Univ.,
259,"Prof. David Bernhard, pathophysiologist and head of the Center for Medical Research at the JKU, explains: During our study, we tried not to restrict ourselves to local effects as much as we could, however we also wanted to explore the systemic effects.",
260,"We examined the state of the diseased, affected tissue as well as individual cells we isolated from the affected tissue.",
261,"By analyzing the blood, we could detect additional full-body changes, again with a goal of identifying potential factors to support early detection.",
262,"In order to be able to interpret the results accordingly, all of these experiments were also conducted on a healthy control group, meaning those who do not suffer from this disease.",
263,The results reveal massive atherosclerotic changes in the tissue and a disease-related disorder of the lipid metabolism.,
264,The experts identified lipid-coupled metabolic pathways that were pathologically altered in the affected cells.,
265,These findings may result in detecting the disease earlier.,
266,"By using various methods (MALDI imaging and staining of tissue sections), scientists not only found that the disease altered the distribution of these lipids in the tissue as a whole, but in the tissue, they were able to identify the responsible enzymes.",
267,"Dr. Christian Doppler added: The most important finding, however, is that there were major differences between the two groups.",
268,"All of the pathological changes described above appeared exclusively in the group that had a normal, tricuspid aortic valve.",
269,"The group that has the bicuspid aortic valve did not show any pathological changes, but resembled the healthy control group at the tissue, cellular and genetic levels.",
270,"These results suggest that symptomatically, this group also has aortic aneurysm, but the cause and pathological development are profoundly different.",
271,"In the future, this finding could result in individualized treatment.",
272,"The final part of the study analyzed blood samples taken from the test subjects which likewise revealed a disease-related increase in specific lipids (phosphatidylcholines, ceramides and acylcarnitines) in the blood.",
273,"This proves that this apparently local, asymptomatic aortic disease systemically effects the body’s circulation.",
274,"The study’s findings also provide important approaches to not only help identify markers and detect the disease early on, but also to develop new approaches in treating it.",
275,Univ.,
276,"Prof. David Bernhard confidently added: The study provides new insight into how aortic aneurysms develop, opening up new ways to detect it early on and create an individual treatment approach.
",
277,The JKU is involved in a new international research project that aims to explore nanomaterial spin waves.,
278,Professor Arthur Ernst In an effort to create a new generation of transistors - and ultimately a new generation of computers - new theories and new experiments are required.,
279,"Together with research institutions in Hamburg and Halle, Prof. Arthur Ernst (Institute for Theoretical Physics at the JKU) is focusing on a search to find non-collinear spin structures in pure and rare earth doped ultrathin ferrites.",
280,"In this case, spins represent tiny magnets that readily align parallel to these ferrites.",
281,Ultrathin layers contain deviating (so-called non-collinear) arrangements and this is raising interesting new questions: How do electrons react on surfaces and on thin films?,
282,How can they change their magnetic properties?,
283,"Ferrites, materials belonging to the iron oxide family, are particularly well-suited for this purpose, along with rare earth metals in lieu of their extremely strong magnetic properties.",
284,Small and sustainable Researchers hope to synthetically manufacture new materials that could take current computer technology to the next level as electron spin waves can be magnetically manipulated without electricity.,
285,"This creates potential, reliable electronic circuits that are much smaller than those found in computers today.",
286,"In addition, these kinds of circuits would also be much more environmentally friendly to manufacture, meaning they could be part of a green electronics system.",
287,The research project is tremendously complex.,
288,"In addition to conventional problems when it comes to reliably conducting nanoscale research, scientists have to create tiny samples enriched with rare earth metals and then examine these samples to determine their crystalline and magnetic properties.",
289,This is where theorists and experimentalists work in tandem.,
290,"Prof. Ernst explained: We have two experimental teams; at the JKU, we have Prof. Andreas Ney (Department of Solid-State Physics) and in Halle, we have Dr. Katayoon Mohseni (Max Planck Institute).",
291,"We don’t want the scientists to fly blind so we need a new, solid theoretical foundation.",
292,He and his team aim to provide the foundation together with Prof. Pawel Buczeck (University of Hamburg).,
293,"First, we will use computer simulations to calculate suited materials.",
294,"We will synthesize the most promising materials and then, as part of a series of experiments, we will study them intently.",
295,The amount of computing power needed is enormous.,
296,Prof. Ernst added: Don’t think of it as a simple program that can run on a standard computer because especially in physics – but in other fields as well - we are now moving into advanced areas that require the use of ultra-modern and extremely high-power computers.,
297,Institutes can no longer perform these kinds of highly complex calculations on their own and require the use of high-performance computers that are jointly owned and operated by several universities and institutions.,
298,The topic is very much in high demand and Prof. Ernst will soon publish a paper in the highly prestigious journal “Advanced Materials” about magnetic vortices in ferromagnets that also require the use of supercomputers to perform calculations.,
299,"A similar article about exchange scaling ultrafast angular momentum transfer in 4f antiferromagnets was recently published in Nature Materials.
",
300,"[Earlier this year, the JKU published a report detailing the worlds first system to track people in dense forest cover in real-time.",
301,The system is now progressing to the next stage.,
302,", Drohnenforschung Professor Bimber Normal, commercially available drones can now use the system.",
303,"Initially, using the system required a special drone equipped with a ten-meter boom containing ten individually mounted cameras.",
304,"The imaging technique, Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), was developed at the JKU (Institute of Computer Graphics; department head: Univ.",
305,Prof. Oliver Bimber),
306,and facilitates the removal of occlusions in individual images caused by foliage in real-time.,
307,"As a result, the system can visibly detect moving objects on the forest floor.",
308,"The next step is to develop the system for use in commercially available drones, meaning special drones would no longer be required.",
309,"The concept behind the new method, Inverse Airborne Optical Sectioning (IAOS), originates in radar technology and involves computationally shifting and integrating the images captured by a hovering camera drone above the forest.",
310,"The required image shift is derived from the object to be tracked on the forest floor, taking direction and speed of movement into account.",
311,"However, as these motion parameters are unknown, JKU researchers have introduced a new method to estimate the parameters using the image data and despite the occlusion.",
312,"The result is an occlusion-free image of the sought-after object (such as a missing person, wildlife, or a vehicle).",
313,The object can also be further pursued or tracked.,
314,"Potential applications include searching for missing individuals, tracking and counting game and wildlife, and terrain monitoring to, for example, protect critical infrastructure.",
315,"In the future, AOS is also expected to be used to help fight forest fires.",
316,The advantages of detecting fire sources early - even before smoke becomes visible or a fire builds – could be crucially decisive.,
317,"The researchers in Linz are also working on enhancing and extending so-called drone swarms, in which multiple drones conduct a search using a co-coordinated approach.

335,"For me personally, working with the philosophers and doctoral candidates is a great pleasure I have an opportunity to discover completely new artistic forms.",
336,"Julian Reiss, a philosopher and the head of the JKU’s Institute for Philosophy and Scientific Method, added: Even for me as a philosopher, the parallels and contrasts between Kepler\s and Galileo\s lives, along with the scientific views and perceptions of science, have been fascinating.",
337,Performing these themes in a light-hearted way with theatrical and musical professionals has been a unique experience for me.,
338,"Audiences can look forward to three days of performances (December 2 and 6, each beginning at 7:30 PM; December 3 at 4:00 PM) by a collective consisting of theater, science and music, that explores the traces of Kepler and Galileo in a playful way, addressing fundamental questions about science’s relationship to the church and capital.",
339,Admission is free; seating is limited seating and we recommend registering in advance to attend: jku.at/zirkus-des-wissens.,

380,Albert Einstein referred certain quantum phenomena as spooky action at a distance.,
381,Quantum systems are just very different from what we experience on a daily basis.,
382,Professor Richard Küng A new study led by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and including the Johannes Kepler University Linz has now shown how machine learning can help to better understand these systems.,
383,"Although quantum physics forms the cornerstone of modern technology, until now, it has been fairly impossible to make concrete predictions in regard to quantum systems.",
384,This is because the quantum world is incredibly complex and even the smallest systems are made up of countless atoms in which particle states overlap with extremely powerful correlations (entanglement).,
385,Describing these systems using equations is simply not scalable.,
386,"A new study just published in the journal Science focuses on just how machine learning tools that run on conventional computers can be used to predict these types of quantum systems, thereby helping researchers solve some of the trickiest problems facing physics and chemistry.",
387,Machine Learning Instead of Quantum Computing Univ.,
388,Prof. Richard Küng (JKU Institute for Integrated Circuits) was instrumental in the study and explains: This is exactly what we expect when it comes to quantum computing.,
389,"While we unfortunately still have a long way to go before we see a fully functional quantum computer, we have, however, now proven mathematically and experimentally that we dont have to wait for these machines of the future.",
390,Machine learning methods can help us learn about important complex quantum system properties using todays quantum architectures.,
391,The new study is the first to mathematically prove that conventional machine learning can be used to bridge the gap between us and the quantum world.,
392,"Equally as important, researchers now better understand how the software reached solutions through extensive numerical simulations.",
393,"Küng added: When it comes to machine learning, this is very rarely the case.",
394,Uses from Pharma to Chemistry Scientists now have a tool to better understand the underlying phase of a quantum state without knowing much about it beforehand.,
395,"This information may significantly contribute to developing new materials, drugs, and environmentally-friendly chemicals (JKU LIT AI Lab) will continue to expand on the research in this field in an effort to bridge the gap between the world of human experience and the quantum world.

438,"Scientists, academics, and professionals are working together closely to deliver new findings and share newfound expertise as quickly as possible The same applies to medical professionals and researchers at the Kepler University Hospital and at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.",
439,"As soon as it was understood just how the pandemic would impact medical facilities and society, many realized that university medicine had to be more involved with objectives in clinical and translational research.",
440,"Two of the COVID-19 symposium organizers, Univ.",
441,Prof. Dr. Clemens Schmitt and Prim.,
442,Priv.-Doz.,
443,"Dr. Bernd Lamprecht, remarked: This high-profile COVID-19 symposium provides an ideal opportunity to not only present the remarkable scientific findings over the past 20 months of the pandemic, but talk about various findings and research approaches and give interested parties an opportunity to hear first-hand how all this has been possible in lieu of conditions related to the pandemic.",
444,"Prof. Dr. Meinhard Lukas, Rector at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, offered: We are currently experiencing the fourth wave of the coronavirus.",
445,"While it is a stressful and difficult time for everyone, it is also a time that is showing each and every one of us just how important science is.",
446,"Ambitious researchers have developed effective vaccines in a very short period of time, and scientists are work relentlessly to conduct research on new treatments.",
447,We need to listen to the experts and trust their judgment.,
448,"On behalf of the entire JKU, I would like to thank Prof. Schmitt and Prim.",
449,Lamprecht for their valuable efforts and for making this COVID 19 Symposium a reality.,
450,"Franz Harnoncourt, CEO of the Kepler University Hospital Ltd., added: Along with the JKU Faculty of Medicine, the Kepler University Hospital’s main goal is to conduct research that truly reaches people.",

452,"I am grateful that we have these kinds of dedicated experts here, especially those who approach the issue of Covid from a wide variety of perspectives but always focus on the patients’ well-being.",
453,Priv.,
454,Doz.,
455,"Dr. Karl-Heinz Stadlbauer, medical director at the Kepler University Hospital, stated: Since the pandemic began, our explicit goal at the Kepler University Hospital has been provide the best patient care possible.",
456,"To this end, we have to be able to draw on well-founded, scientific findings.",
457,The fact that the JKU Faculty of Medicine is now located in close proximity to the hospital is ideal; we can network and the research opportunities are at hand.,
458,"I am proud to have employees who are among the best in their field, both in research and healthcare.",
459,"Overview of Presentations by Medical Professionals and Researchers: Bernd Lamprecht, deputy Dean of Academic Affairs at the JKU Faculty of Medicine and head of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at the Kepler University Hospital.",
460,"COVID-19 Healthcare in Upper Austria - Experiences at the Kepler University Hospital: The Kepler University Hospital has treated over 2,500 patients for COVID-19 since the spring of 2020 and as a result, has acquired a great deal of expertise in the field.",
461,"From the start, medical professionals acquired experience in treating COVID-19 by actively taking part in large clinical trials, such as SOLIDARITY and DISCOVERY, as well as sharing information with worldwide partners as part of a WHO initiative.",
462,"In addition, patients had access to proven treatments as well as findings from an interesting range of drug studies (ranging from the Penninger preparation to new approaches as part of the Austrian ACOVACT study).",
463,"Helmut Salzer, Senior Physician at the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at the Kepler University Hospital “COVID-19 Clinical Trials”: We have continuously provided medical care to COVID-19 patients at our infectious diseases ward since the pandemic began.",
464,We have always believed in providing translational access to science and working closely with other departments and institutes.,
465,"As a teaching hospital, we believe it is important to provide our patients with the best evidence-based medicine, but also play our part to provide a better understanding of this new infectious disease by conducting research and collaborating with others.",
466,"At the start of the pandemic in particular and as part of complex treatment studies, we were able to provide our COVID-19 patients with a therapeutic advantage.",
467,"Rupert Langer, head of the Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology at the JKU, Professor of Pathology and Molecular Pathology at the JKU.",
468,COVID-19:,
469,What is the Pathological Perspective?,
470,"During the initial phase of the pandemic in particular, pathology contributed significantly to describing and understanding the Covid-19 through patient autopsies.",
471,We are seeing severe pulmonary damage in almost all patients which vary at different stages depending on the duration and progression of the disease.,
472,"In addition, we can create a visualization of complications, such as superinfections or fungal infection in the lungs, as well as explore the way other organs respond and are impacted.",
473,"Post-mortem examinations revealed a high risk of infection, particularly during the earlier period when a vaccine was unavailable.",
474,We were able to reduce this by creating techniques for limited and minimally invasive postmortem procedures.,
475,"The preserved lung tissue and organ samples are available for additional scientific study, i.e. of a molecular genetic nature.",
476,"The Institute of Clinical Pathology and Molecular Pathology at the KUK has over 1000 preserved tissue samples from over 100 deceased individuals, some of which have been processed to a great extent and are now being further analyzed as a whole.",
477,"Jens Meier, head of the Department of Anesthesiology and Operative Intensive Care Medicine, head of the Department of Neuroanesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine at the Kepler University Hospital, Professor of Anesthesiology and Operative Intensive Care Medicine at the JKU.",
478,"Challenges in Intensive Care to Treat Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients Since the start of the first wave, teams at various ICUs have face major challenges in treating COVID-19 patients.",
479,"While we knew little at the start of the pandemic in regard to ICU treatment and the required safety protocols, as we experienced more waves, we began to realize that caring for COVID-19 patients is highly complex and protracted.",
480,ECMO therapy in particular has pushed ICU medicine to its limits.,
481,"Soyoung Lee, Professor of Tumor Biology at the JKU “Virus-Induced Senescence as a Newly Identified Driver and Treatment of COVID-19”: Prof. Soyoung Lee’s current study shows how host cells respond to a SARS-CoV-2 infection and determine the progression of COVID-19.",
482,Viral infection triggers a stress response in host cells that is also a protective program called cellular senescence.,
483,"While senescent cells stop proliferating and halt the proliferation of damaged cells, at the same time they create signals (cytokines) that activate inflammatory cascades, damaging the patient\s organs.",
484,"In this regard, targeting senescent cells may reduce the massive release of cytokines (cytokine storm) and lung damage, thereby giving us a new option to treat COVID-19 patients.",
485,"Rainer Hintenberger, Senior Physician at the Department of Internal Medicine - Gastroenterology/Hepatology at the Kepler University Hospital B and T Cell Specific Vaccination Response in Recovered and Non-Recovered KUK Employees: The present study shows that hospital personnel are at high risk of contracting COVID-19.",
486,Recovered medical personnel have a good vaccine response on B and T-cell level after receiving one dose of the vaccine compared to those who were not infected with COVID-19.,
487,"Clemens Schmitt, head of the Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology at the Kepler University Hospital, Professor of Hematology and Internal Oncology at the JKU Humoral and Cellular Immune Response to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Cancer Patients",
488,A study focused on 87 tumor patients and 44 control subjects in regard to antibody-based and cell-based immune responses after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.,
489,Approximately one-quarter of the tumor patients did not attain a positive antibody response whereas all of the control subjects developed antibodies.,
490,"In the tumor group, patients with hematologic tumors in particular (such as lymphoma) - and especially after CD20 antibody therapy - contribute to the lack of success in developing antibodies after receiving the vaccine.",
491,"Only about 10% of all tumor patients actively receiving drug therapy display a complete lack of antibody-based and T-cell-based immune response; however, about 30% show either a lack of antibody or a lack of T-cell responses.",
492,Follow-up studies intend to show how long T-cell immune responses alone last and to what extent they protect against severe COVID-19 progression.,
493,"Daniel Kiblböck, Senior Physician at the Department of Cardiology and Internal Intensive Care Medicine at the Kepler University Hospital Bioptic Evaluation of Suspected Myocarditis Cases after the mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has reported an increase of myocarditis after receiving the mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",
494,Our study in cooperation with the Cardiopathology Department of the University Hospital Tübingen explored myocardial biopsies in 24 patients suspected of myocarditis after receiving the mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.,
495,"In addition to cases of acute lymphocytic myocarditis, we saw cases of chronic and healing myocarditis as well as cardiac sarcoidosis and cases of non-specific myocardial damage.",
496,"This seldom seen side effect of the mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should not, however, lessen its value as a very important preventive measure to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.",
497,"Sabine Enengl, Senior Physician at the Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Endocrinology COVID-19 and Pregnancy: Pregnant women are showing an increased risk of a severe course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the non-pregnant patient population, even if most patients have no, or only mild, symptoms.",
498,"To date, approximately 170 recovered or ill patients have delivered babies at the Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics, and Gynecologic Endocrinology at the KUK.",
499,One patient was critically ill and needed intensive medical care.,
500,"By analyzing the immunizing antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of affected patients, we can draw conclusions about how to potentially protect newborns from an infection.n.",
501,"Wolfram Hötzenecker, head of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Professor of Dermatology and Venereology at the JKU COVID-19 from a Dermatological Perspective: Covid-19 is visible on the skin: As part of a study, scientists and physicians at the Department of Dermatology studied skin symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19.",
502,"Although these skin rashes are not diagnostically useful, they occur in about 20% of patients as an accompanying symptom.",
503,"Irene Tiemann-Boege, Professor at the JKU Institute of Biophysics “Optimizing the SARS-CoV-2 PCR Test”: What is really behind a PCR test for the coronavirus?",
504,"The media regularly touts PCR testing in its reports and expects everyone to understand, but do they really?",
505,"The presentation focused on explaining what a PCR test is, its advantages and limitations, and how it compares to the standard rapid antigen test to detect a COVID-19 infection.",
506,"David Bernhard, head of the Center for Medical Research at the JKU Faculty of Medicine, Professor at the Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology / Department of Pathophysiology at the JKU.",
507,"Developing SARS-CoV-2 for Testing at Schools: Since the start of the pandemic, advances in clinical research have made detecting and treating SARS-CoV2 arguably unique in the history of medicine.",
508,"The speed and quality to develop new, high-quality tests and testing systems to detect infection and build antibodies to protect against SARS-CoV2 is equally as unique.",
509,"Our developments in the area of testing and their applications, particularly as part of an Austria-wide study on schools and at Upper Austrian pharmacies, have generated exciting findings.",
510,"Tim von Oertzen, head of the Department of Neurology 1 at the Kepler University Hospital, Hhad of the Center for Geriatric Medicine Long COVID and Post COVID from a Neurological Perspective Symptoms persisting for more than 28 days after having contracted COVID is called Long COVID; symptoms persisting for over three months is referred to as Post-COVID Syndrome.",
511,The Neurology Department created a Post COVID Outpatient Clinic.,
512,Most of the affected patients had a mild case of COVID-19 and did not require hospitalization.,
513,The most common symptom is fatigue (chronic fatigue).,
514,"We are conducting a prospective exploratory study parallel to the outpatient clinic to identify molecular biomarkers related to inflammation, thrombophilia, neurodegeneration and genetic predisposition in patients who neurologically show long COVID symptoms.
",
515,What is more important when it comes to research: theory or conducting experiments?,
516,"In an ideal world, both, as demonstrated by a collaboration effort between the Johannes Kepler University Linz and the Max Planck Institute in Halle.",
517,The Linz physicists succeeded in providing the theoretical explanation for surprising experimental outcomes in Germany.,
518,Arthur Ernst,
519,"The German researchers used X-ray spectroscopy to determine certain CrTe2 structures and came across skyrmions, which are tiny magnetic vortex nodes that behave like particles.",
520,"As skyrmions have large spin structures, they are relatively impervious to interfering influences and are promising candidates for use as information carriers, ranging from conventional storage media to potential applications in advanced quantum computers.",
521,"Skyrmions, however, like to make themselves scarce and only a few materials have the properties to form these kinds of spin structures.",
522,CrTe2 is not one of them.,
523,Univ.,
524,Prof. Dr. Arthur Ernst (Department of Many-Particle Systems at the JKU) explained: Skyrmions actually only form when the material is magnetic but not centrosymmetric.,
525,Centrosymmetric (also called point symmetry) is a geometric figure when it is mapped onto itself by reflection at a symmetry point.,
526,"Although CrTe2 has matching magnetic properties, it is also centrosymmetric and subsequently unsuitable for skyrmions.",
527,The German researchers were therefore surprised to discover the spin structures.,
528,A Defective System Works Better,
529,"Seeking advice, they turned to the experts in Linz, who were indeed able to solve the puzzle.",
530,"The scientists in Halle used samples that contained defects, meaning they were not completely pure.",
531,"Prof. Ernst remarked: These defects broke the symmetry, allowing skyrmions to form.",
532,"To be specific, this defect is an excess of 30% of Cr atoms.",
533,"Prof. Ernst added: This violates the stichometry, meaning changes the chemical composition.",
534,His team is now developing methods and targeted approaches to induce this kind of symmetry-breaking effect.,
535,"The JKU physicist stated: The approach could be used to elicit spin structures in a wide range of magnetic materials, resulting in new approaches when it comes to information storage media.",
536,"As you can see, not all defects result in failure.

541,"We spoke with Mirjam Strecker about Diversity Month: What is it, why do we have it, and what is the JKU doing to strengthen and support diversity.",
542,Mirjam Strecker is the audit officer for Hochschule und Familie and is also responsible for cross mentoring and school projects.,
543,"What is Diversity Month Mirjam Strecker: First launched in May 2020, the European Diversity Month was initially created to mark the 10th anniversary of the European Diversity Charter Platform.",
544,"This year, Diversity Month will focus on Building Bridges.",
545,"Organizations across Europe are being invited to advocate and promote diversity and take action accordingly by, for example, planning internal and external events focusing on diversity inclusion issues, showcasing their diversity policies, organizing virtual or hybrid awareness-raising workshops, or running a social media campaign.",
546,"Detailed information about the 2022 EU Diversity Month 2022 is available here (https://eudiversity2022.eu/european-diversity-month-2022/, opens an external URL in a new window).",
547,Why is the JKU involved in Diversity Month?,
548,"Mirjam Strecker: The JKU’s Diversity Strategy was published in May of 2021, closely followed by the JKU Equality Plan published in June of 2021.",
549,"The Diversity Month project meets crucial goals and measures as outlined in these two documents, thereby serving as a cornerstone to support our policies in the area of diversity and equality.",
550,"Furthermore, everyone at all university levels should become more aware of issues in the area of equality.",
551,The JKU would like to be involved in the EU Diversity Month platform annually as a long-term opportunity for reflection as well as an initiative to kick-start our own activities.,
552,"Detailed information about the JKU’s 2022 Diversity Month is available at (www.jku.at/diversity, opens an external URL in a new window).",
553,"In terms of diversity, what does the JKU consider important?",
554,Mirjam Strecker: There is strength in diversity.,
555,"Diversity not only enables the plurality of convictions, it’s open to – and welcomes - different lifestyles.",
556,"People’s colors and diversity broaden our horizons, giving us an opportunity to see things in new ways and support our level of creativity.",
557,"We want to practice our appreciation, regardless of gender identity, or those with and without disabilities, and with people in Austria as well as other parts of the world.",
558,"Together, with our individual strengths and weaknesses.",
559,we make up the JKU.,
560,"Whether it is about students, faculty members, or administrative services, we want to work together to create the best possible university for all of us.
",
561,The JKU’s “Critical Tram” campaign has been selected as November’s “tram of the month”.,
562,The JKU Critical Tram “We’re Young –,
563,So We Can” is the JKU’s campaign slogan calling for more critical questioning and having the courage to look at things from new perspectives.,
564,"In other words, just what are we actually allowed to do?",
565,Ask uncomfortable questions?,
566,Exactly!,
567,But we can do much more than that: we can – and should - be curious.,
568,"Curiosity is what propels and drives us forward to break up old structures and, if necessary, strike out in new directions.",
569,One of the elements created to promote the campaign’s message included a Linz AG tram featuring the campaign design.,
570,"The result was not only a lot of buzz, but an award as well.",
571,"The JKU Tram is one of the winners of the 2021 October Transport Media Awards and is now eligible to be considered for the 2022 Out of Home Award presented in recognition of the most creative outdoor advertising campaigns during 2021.
",
572,"The JKU has developed a method to conceal individual, personal traits when searching for information but without compromising search and recommendation results.",
573,Professor Markus Schedl Interested in finding out just which artists are currently topping the pop charts?,
574,Or would you like some suggestions to see a movie today?,
575,"Modern search engines and recommendation systems apply artificial intelligence and deep learning methods, meaning you get a precise answer to your question but at the same time, the system can also predict your personal preferences with astonishing accuracy.",
576,"For example, in regard to movies or music, your gender can be correctly inferred 72% of the time just from your user behavior.",
577,Researchers at the Johannes Kepler University Linz have recently developed a method designed to conceal your individual preferences but without impairing the search and recommendation results.,
578,"In an effort to prevent recommendation systems from predicting the user’s personal preferences, Prof. Markus Schedl and his colleagues at the JKU Institute for Computational Perception have developed their own deep learning architecture: Adversarial Variational Auto-Encoder with Multinomial Likelihood, in short Adv-MultVAE.",
579,"During this process, two networks are activated and while they work separately, they are also closely linked.",
580,"One network solves the actual task, meaning it finds the music or movies that the user might be interested in.",
581,The second network makes the big difference as it tries to predict sensitive personal information (such as gender or nationality) as accurately as possible.,
582,"In contrast to conventional recommendation system algorithms, the JKU networks take on a different direction at that point.",
583,"The working parameters are gradually adjusted so that while recommendations results remain the same, the system is less accurate when it comes to predicting the user’s personal attributes.",
584,"In the end, the networks experience an evolution that provides good search results but is weak when it comes to predicting personal information.",
585,A Lower Rate of Predictive Accuracy Researchers tested the new system using music and movie datasets.,
586,"The prediction accuracy in regard to the user’s gender was reduced by 57% when it came to movies and 62% when it came to music; in terms of recommendation quality, the results remained the same.",
587,"In addition to protecting the user\s personal information, this method also has another advantage.",
588,"Markus Schedl explains: Because our new recommendation systems no longer know the users’ exact genders, it suggests a broader spectrum of music and movies.",
589,"This means that men also get recommendations for movies often considered to be ‘chick flicks’, such as Casablanca.",
590,"As a result, our approach also counteracts stereotypes as well as creating ‘bubbles’ on the Internet.",
591,The JKU algorithm has yet to work better for women.,
592,"Schedl added: It is probably on account of simply having more information provided by men, or women’s user behavior is different than men.",
593,"In this regard, there are plans to further develop the system and include a stronger focus on traits that are considered to be more feminine.",
594,The Algorithm is Openly Available The findings and the algorithm were recently published during the Top Information Retrieval Conference (ACM SIGIR) and are openly available.,
595,"Schedl remarked: Everything you need to implement it, such as the source code, datasets, etc., is available in our Github account.",
596,"So, if you have a bit of expertise in the area, we invite you to test the algorithm yourself.

",
672,"Published in the journal Science, a team of researchers describes a new signal transduction mechanism in the hippocampus.",
673,"Professor Maren Engelhardt The standard textbook opinion is fairly undisputed: nerve cells in the brain receive information via their dendrites (branch-like cytoplasmic extensions of a cell), transmitting and processing them in the cell body before generating a potential action in the so-called axon, which then sends the information to the nearest nerve cell.",
674,"A new publication in the journal Science has revealed initial evidence showing that some nerve cells in the brain\s memory center, the hippocampus of all places, do not conform.",
675,How do they do it and why?,
676,"In order to keep the brain physiologically functioning, normal neuronal networks are controlled by a working rhythm.",
677,"Disrupting the system’s balance can result in significant disorders, such as epilepsy.",
678,"The standard nerve cell is made up of finely branched dendrites resembling tree branches, serving as a type of ‘input station’ to receive signals from other cells, the cell body, and the arising axon, and generating an all-or-nothing signal, the so-called action potential.",
679,The axon transmits signals to the downstream nerve cell.,
680,"The nerve cell receives activating and inhibitory signals via the dendrites and the cell body, which are then processed together in the cell body.",
681,"Based on whether excitation or inhibition is predominant, to put it simply, the signals are transmitted or not, amplified or weakened.",
682,This is how the brain protects itself from ‘overloading’ since not every incoming impulse is equally important.,
683,"Discovering Blueprint Deviations Researchers have discovered that about half of the neurons located in the hippocampus not only do not conform to this standard blueprint, but in some cases, there are even considerable deviations (see attached image).",
684,Researchers have shown in previous studies that about half of these pyramidal cells in the axon originate directly from a dendrite as opposed to the cell body.,
685,"This is important as normally many of the inhibitory synapses are attached to the cell body itself, thereby influencing signal processing significantly.",
686,"Directly inhibiting the cell body plays a key role in synchronizing signal processing and transmission between areas of the brain in, for example, in triggering resting periods.",
687,"Accordingly, it is an important component of the aforementioned network’s ‘working rhythm’.",
688,PD Dr. Martin Both and Univ.,
689,Prof. Dr. Maren Engelhardt elaborated: The pyramidal cell’s axon does not originate in the cell body but further away at a dendrite; so we asked ourselves whether or not it can evade this important inhibition.,
690,"The physiologist from Heidelberg and the JKU anatomy professor have worked together professionally for several years, contributing their respective expertise in anatomy and physiology to this interdisciplinary project that focuses primarily on nerve cells and their structural-functional relationships.",
691,"So, what happens inside of a neuronal network once the nerve cells – referred to as AcD cells - become active?",
692,Dr. Both and Prof. Engelhardt explained: A \signal short circuit\ allows nerve cells containing an axon at the dendrite to bypass the activity rhythm imposed by the neuronal network.,
693,"The incoming signals do not even pass through the cell body, which are down-regulated during resting phases, but rather they enter the axon directly, triggering an action potential faster and more directly.",
694,"The researchers added: The more inhibited the pyramidal cells are, the more important the mechanism seems to be.",
695,"The reason is that only then are these special cells containing a dendrite-axon conduction active, while their ‘colleagues’ are asleep.",
696,Just what kind of information is so important that it is passed on despite being in the resting phase?,
697,It is a mystery that researchers intend to explore further.,
698,The researchers suspect that this may be the brain’s way of ensuring that it retains important information.,
699,The hippocampus’ anatomy and its connective functions could perhaps indicatively explain why so many AcD neurons seem to be there in particular.,
700,"Mammals have two hippocampi, one on each side of the brain in the depth of the temporal lobe, playing a key role in transferring memories from short-term to long-term memory.",
701,They are also responsible for location memory.,
702,"In addition, the two hippocampi synchronize the brain’s two hemispheres.",
703,The researchers speculated: Perhaps the cells we studied are responsible for maintaining communication between the brain’s hemispheres.,

732,F.l.:,
733,"Armando Rastelli, Christian Schimpf and Saimon Covre da Silva; Photo credit: JKU As part of an international partnership, researchers at the Johannes Kepler University Linz have succeeded in advancing the storage capacity of quantum information.",
734,"If anything, solid-state based nanostructures are one thing for sure: teeny tiny.",
735,They are less than 50 nanometers in size.,
736,"In comparison, viruses are considered big, up to 400 nanometers in size.",
737,"While conventional data storage uses semiconductor structures in memory cards, quantum computers do not as yet.",
738,Semiconductor-based nanostructures can also be used as sources of quantum information (Qbits) - a function they perform exceedingly well.,
739,"However, quantum information must also be stored, for example, in the spin of a single electron - and semiconductor-based nanostructures very modestly fulfill this function.",
740,Univ.,
741,"Prof. Armando Rastelli, head of the JKU’s Department of Semiconductor Physics, explained: Quantum information is very transient on account of electron interaction and noise by atomic nuclei.",
742,Advancements at the LIT Open Innovation Center in the JKU Clean Room Using unconventional and electrically controllable nanostructures have now proved to be successful.,
743,"In contrast to past attempts, individual electron spins were set as quantum information as part of stress-free nanostructures made out of gallium arsenide.",
744,These samples were created at the JKU’s clean room.,
745,The result was extending the quantum information (Qbits) storage time by a factor of 100!,
746,"In terms of absolute numbers, the applicability is still a long way off as the information was only stored for 0.1 milliseconds.",
747,"Rastelli added: However, my team, consisting of Santanu Manna, Saimon Covre da Silva, and Christian Schimpf, has demonstrated that with the right selection of materials and the right approach, semiconductor nanostructures have the potential.",
748,"In collaboration with scientists at universities in Cambridge, Oxford and Sheffield, the experiments were published in the renowned journal, Nature Nanotechnology, under the title Ideal Refocusing of an Optically Active Spin Qubit Under Strong Hyperfine Interactions.",
749,Rastelli believes this line of research is promising.,
750,"In 2018, the same selection of materials was used at the JKU to generate the worlds highest degree of photon pair entanglement from semiconductor nanostructures and then successfully applied to quantum cryptography in 2021.]
",
751,"In order to accumulate renewable energy and access it when needed, a considerable amount of electricity storage is needed.",
752,Prof. Schöfberger is working on a solution.,
753,"Professor Schöfberger Chemist Wolfgang Schöfberger explains that on account of its high energy density, metal-air batteries are promising.",
754,"However, as they are “sluggish” in their oxygen response when charging and discharging, he has developed a new catalyst designed for the air electrode.",
755,The study was published in the scientific journal Angewandte Chemie.,
756,"Schöfberger conducts research at the JKU’s Institute of Organic Chemistry and explained that metal-air batteries store electrical energy by means of chemical reactions, for example, at a zinc electrode and the outside environment, which is later released.",
757,"When discharging, there is an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); when charging, there is an oxygen evolution reaction (OER).",
758,"The researcher added: As part of the study, we introduced a new catalyst to coat the electrodes.",
759,"It\s bifunctional, so it supports both reducing and generating oxygen.",
760,The catalyst is composed of cobalt and ring-shaped carbon-nitrogen compounds.,
761,"Zinc is one of the most common elements in the earths crust and can be used as the metal electrode, Schöfberger says.",
762,"This means that metal-air batteries do not require expensive precious metals, such as platinum, ruthenium or iridium.",
763,", The catalyst coating produces nearly 100% selective activity during the oxygen-reduction reaction, the researcher noted.",
764,"The oxygen generating reaction, in turn, takes place with it and is 98% efficiency.",
765,"Schöfberger believes these results are promising.
",
766,"When it comes to addressing various global challenges ranging from healthcare, energy, and the environment, to information technologies, nanotechnology is rapidly emerging as a pivotal area.",
767,"The 4D-NMR Project Researchers are still, however, studying most of the nanomaterials by applying bulk methods that average through large samples rather than studying individual nanostructures using true nanosensors.",
768,"While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a critical approach in biochemical synthesis and medical imaging, it is inherently limited to large numbers of molecules.",
769,"In response to this challenge, the new 4D-NMR project aims to revolutionize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology by improving its sensitivity and resolution to image single molecules at the nanoscale level.",
770,"To this end, the 4D NMR team will utilize the atomic resolution capabilities of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) along with resonant, high-frequency electromagnetic excitation and readout techniques.",
771,The latter will also include significant advances in GHz and RF technology.,
772,"The project brings five partners from Austria, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom together.",
773,The European Innovation Councils (EIC) Pathfinder program will provide over €3 million in funding over the next three years.,
774,The EIC supports research that explores bold ideas to come up with radically new technologies.,
775,", In an effort to identify the 3D chemical structures of complex molecules in three dimensions, 4D-NMR aims to advance single-molecule magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) technologies.",
776,"Technological advances in this area are expected to revolutionize NMR spectroscopy, transforming it into an imaging technique featuring sub-molecular spatial resolution.",
777,"By applying synchronized magnetic pulse excitations, 4D NMR will translate the sample’s dynamics under study into the fourth dimension, which could significantly impact various fields such as the life sciences, materials science, and chemical applications in which processes involving small amounts of chemical or biological molecules need to be detected.",
778,The fact that this technology can be applied not only in vacuums but also in situ in liquids makes it particularly interesting for these fields.,
779,This constitutes a significant advantage when compared to commercial NMRs.,
780,"Dr. Georg Gramse, project coordinator at the JKU’s Institute of Biophysics, remarked: The goal is to build a system that can operate at the single spin level in complex spin systems.",
781,"The ability to resolve individual spins will allow researchers to acquire a deeper understanding of molecular interactions and processes at the atomic level, which could significantly impact a number of industries, including pharmaceuticals, materials sciences, and biotechnologies.

782,"Delta and Omicron, the current SARS-CoV-2 variants, have spike-like projections that attach themselves to human cells faster, longer, and stronger.",
783,Coronavirus_Credit_Pixabay,
784,"As part of a publication in the journal Nature Communications, JKU researchers are reporting that this distinguishes these variants from Coronavirus variants seen at the beginning of the pandemic.",
785,"The pathogens are absorbed more quickly and airflow, mucus, or blood flow are less likely to easily detached then from the host cells.",
786,"A team led by Peter Hinterdorfer (Institute of Biophysics, JKU) analyzed just how Coronavirus spikes attach to human cell surfaces by using atomic force microscopy and computer simulations.",
787,The researchers reported that the spikes (made up from three identical components) rapidly change shape once they attach to ACE2 proteins on the cell surface.,
788,"As a result, their grasping zones (receptor binding domains) rotate in an arcuate motion and together, they cover almost an entire circular area of 360 degrees.",
789,"The researchers explained: Its highly dynamic, molecular grip forms up to three tight bonds with ACE2 on the cell surface.",
790,"Compared to the original variant (Wuhan-1), the spikes on the Delta and Omicron variants bind the virus significantly stronger and longer to the host cell’s ACE2 molecules.",
791,"Most notably, the Delta variant adheres faster, and Omicron ten times longer.",
792,"The research team, which includes Austrian molecular biologist Josef Penninger (head the Life Sciences Institute (LSI) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada), noted that the shift in binding dynamics among currently circulating variants increases their virulence and viral transmission.
",
793,"According to Statistics Austria, inflation dropped in March, but consumers have not yet responded accordingly.",
794,Professor Christoph Teller,
795,"According to a recent survey conducted by the JKU’s Institute for Retail, Sales and Marketing (IHaM), price increases continue to negatively impact the Austrians’ consumer behavior and consumers have not yet responded to the declining rate of inflation.",
796,"Although recovering slowly, consumer confidence continues to be very negative.",
797,The most recent IHaM long-term analysis confirms an ongoing reluctance to spend money in the retail sector.,
798,"Across all three survey cycles (April 2022, September 2022, and April 2023), 30% of the adult population stated that on account of higher retail prices, they have been buying fewer goods.",
799,The reluctance to spend money has been ongoing for an entire year with no end in sight.,
800,Three quarters of consumers expect retail prices to continue to rise over the next three months and consumer attitudes are generally known to influence consumer behavior.,
801,"Sales Continue to be Popular When shopping, 75% of Austrians (age 18+) continue to pay greater attention to sales and promotions.",
802,The same applied to 75% of adults in April 2022; only in September 2022 did the proportion briefly fall to 68%.,
803,"59% are currently buying cheaper retail products (such as store brands), the same proportion as in April 2022.",
804,"Albeit slight, there has, however, been a decline compared to peak numbers in September 2022 (64%).Online Research Helps Only to a Limited Extent Consumers\ initial fallback strategy to mitigate price hikes by looking online became almost obsolete six months after prices began to rise.",
805,"While 43% of consumers continued to search for lower-priced products online in April 2022, the figure dropped to 28% by September 2022, and the figure remained fairly stable in April 2023 (29%).",
806,"On a smaller scale, the same applies to a rise in online shopping.",
807,"While 20% of Austrians were still trying to counter inflation by ordering more online in April 2022, this figure had dropped to only 17% by April 2023 as online retailers have also had to begin factoring rising costs into their price calculations.",
808,Options to Save on Purchases are Limited Only 15% of adult Austrians would like to - or can - cut back on spending in order to avoid having to save on their purchases.,
809,"This compares to 16% in September 2022, and 11% in April 2022.",
810,Only 8% of consumers indicated that they would consider using their savings to shop.,
811,"This means that the current share is roughly at the same level as six months ago (11%), and a year ago (9%).",
812,4% would actually even be willing to overdraw their bank account in order to make retail purchases.,
813,"Again, over time, there have been fewer (major) changes.",
814,Dr. Ernst Gittenberger summarized the IHaM’s current analysis findings: The IHaM’s most recent long-term analysis confirms that there is a continuing consumer reluctance to shop which is in line with the theme ‘the same procedure as last year’.,
815,"In regard to consumer behavior, the survey indicators show little change between April 2022 and April 2023 and that is not good news.",
816,Austrians continue to be affected by inflation and it impacts their consumer behavior.,
817,"For the time being, there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight.",
818,"Prof. Dr. Christoph Teller, head of IHaM, describes the difficult situation retail companies face: The retail sector is in a bind.",
819,"On one hand, retailers are trying to counteract the negative consumer sentiment by offering sales, promotions, and cheaper products.",
820,"On the other hand, low margins coupled with high and rising costs make it fairly impossible to generally forego price increases.",
821,"When shopping on a daily basis, consumers increasingly consider the non-discounted standard product price to be more of a luxury item.",
822,"In the retail sector, special offers and extensive product discounting are increasingly becoming the new normal.",
823,"It can be like a drug for consumers, creating a quick ‘high’ but in the long-term, it becomes a hard habit to kick.",
824,"Whether or not retailers and consumers will be able to kick the habit remains to be seen once the crisis is over.

887,"Prof. Achim Walter Hassel, head of the Institute for Chemical Technology of Inorganic Substances at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, is an internationally renowned expert in research on rare metals.",
888,Just how important is this rare earth metal discovery in Sweden?,
889,Prof. Hassel: There are two aspects to this find.,
890,One side relates to trade policies.,
891,"The majority of rare earth elements come from China, and more and more are coming from the USA as well.",
892,"In the past, during the conflict over the Senkaku Islands near Taiwan, China actually suspended its supply of rare earth elements to Japan in order to put more pressure on Japan.",
893,Being dependent on Chinas goodwill leaves the rest of the world vulnerable to extortion.,
894,The solution here could be production in Europe and this is exactly why this discovery is significant.,
895,",",
896,The other aspect concerns research.,
897,These rare earth metals are tremendously important as their electronic structures mean that these rare earth metals are unique and have certain magnetic and photometric properties.,
898,Europium is used when making fluorescent lamps and LED lighting.,
899,The rare earth elements neodymium and samarium are used in magnets.,
900,Gadolinium is used in medicine for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) applications.,
901,Yttrium is in YAG lasers and the lambda probe is used to help reduce gas control exhaust emissions in cars as well as to measure levels of oxygen during steel production as part of the Linz-Donawitz process.,
902,"Scandium is an alloy component used to produce high-strength aluminum for the Airbus A380, or high-quality racing bike frames.",
903,Erbium and terbium are used in light amplifiers and light valves which are essential Internet components.,
904,The oxide in cerium is widely used to produce important abrasives and polishing agents.,
905,"These are just a few examples and as you can see, rare metals are important as we need them for a very broad range of applications.",
906,"Jan Moström, the head of the Swedish mining company that disclosed the find, referred to the deposit as good news, not just for the region and for Sweden, but for Europe and the climate.",
907,What does he mean by that?,
908,"Prof. Hassel: He\s right because we need large quantities of neodymium and samarium to not only help produce electric motors for electric cars, but also for the permanent magnets contained in wind energy generators.",
909,"In this regard, the find is certainly of relevance in terms of climate policy.",
910,Just how rare are rare earth elements?,
911,"Prof. Hassel: In truth, in terms of quantity, they are not all that rare.",
912,"As stable elements, they are more common than silver, platinum and gold.",
913,"These elements are found only in very scattered locations and, as in Sweden, they are often mined only as a by-product.",
914,"The term rare earth elements presumably refers more to their unique, rarely occurring properties.",
915,"As you conduct research on rare earth metals, just how important are these metals?",
916,"Prof. Hassel: We are always on the lookout for inexpensive, environmentally-friendly production methods.",
917,Rare earth elements are appealing because you often just need a very small amount of these metals to attain the desired effect.,
918,This is probably why they also go by the nickname of spice metals.,
919,What are you currently working on?,
920,Prof. Hassel: My research focuses on introducing selective disruptions to metal alloys.,
921,"They then lose their crystalline character and exhibit special properties, such as an extremely smooth surface or significantly higher resistance to corrosion.",
922,"In technical terms, the alloys become amorphous.",
923,"In cooperation with voestalpine, researchers at a Christian Doppler laboratory developed an amorphous zinc alloy that can be applied even more thinly to surfaces.",
924,"The method can also be used to produce high-strength, low weight aluminum alloys.",
925,"Alloys used for implants can be created based on magnesium and other metals found in human bodies; after a certain period of time, these will then dissolve on their own.

926,The International Welcome Center (IWC) now serves as a central point of contact for international employees at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.,
927,"State Minister Achleitner, councilperson Almir Balihodzic, Sonja Falkner-Matzinger, Vanessa Fuchs (Austrian Student Union), Rector Lukas, and VR Koch at the grand opening.",
928,"Co-financed by the state of Upper Austria, Markus Achleitner, State Minister of Business and Research, and local council member, Almir Balihodzic, recently toured the newly open center.",
929,JKU Rector Meinhard Lukas remarked: The JKU considers itself a university with strong regionally-based roots but also as an internationally oriented university with the capability to consistently adapt to overall social conditions.,
930,"In recent years, globalization, digitalization, and growing demands on Linz as a location of higher education have resulted in the JKU becoming more and more international in the areas of research and teaching.",
931,"New academic degree programs, such as the English-language \Artificial Intelligence\ degree program, international research groups, and so-called Labs at the Linz Institute of Technology are just a couple of examples.",
932,"As a result of increased internationalization in education and research (the JKU currently has 25 English-language degree programs), the number of international employees has risen steadily over the past few years.",
933,"There is currently a total of approximately 3,500 international students (including Erasmus students) at the JKU and over 700 international employees.",
934,"The rise in the number of international students and employees has resulted in creating the IWC to address special needs in regard to information, assistance, etc.",
935,"Sonja Falkner-Matzinger, head of the IWC, added: The International Welcome Center is new at the JKU Linz, playing a key role as an initial point of contact for prospective students, students, and employees who have international backgrounds.",
936,"We aim to create a \welcoming culture\ for international students and employees as well as provide important information and consultation services for long-term perspectives, even after graduation.",
937,"The IWCs responsibilities include providing students with academic advising services regarding their stay in Austria, mediating in matters between students and faculty members or administrative staff, and organizing and supervising the MORE program.",
938,"The IWC does not assist with student exchange programs (meaning the Erasmus program, etc.); the JKU’s International Office will continue to organize student exchange programs.",
939,", Organizationally, the IWC is part of the JKU department International Welcome Center and Ombuds Office for Students.",
940,Financial funding has been made available by grants provided by the state of Upper Austria.,
941,The IWC offers services to target groups with the intention of making their stay more pleasant as well as provide support to live and work in Upper Austria.,
942,"The objective is to strengthen core skills and key technologies, thereby supporting the region of Upper Austria as a successful location of business and research.",
943,"Markus Achleitner, state minister for Business and Research, learned more about the Center during a recent tour and Mayor Klaus Luger (represented by local councilman Almir Balihodzic at the event) supports the new International Welcome Center: Markus Achleitner, State Minister for Business and Research, commented: Research is becoming increasingly international and plays a key role in ensuring the capacity to support innovation, both locally as well as throughout all of Austria.",
944,"To this end, we need cooperation and competition among the best minds, new momentum and ideas, and active exchange as part of a global network.",
945,The JKU’s new International Welcome Center will contribute significantly to this.,
946,"Mayor Klaus Luger added: The new International Welcome Center is another milestone in an effort to better position the JKU, serving as an information provider and pooling resources and services to better support international students and faculty members.",
947,The IWC Supervises Students in the MORE Program The JKU has been a part of the uniko’s (Austrian University Conference) MORE initiative since the fall of 2015.,
948,The initiative was created to support refugees and displaced persons holding higher education qualifications as they continue to pursue a degree.,
949,Those who have refugee or displaced status - regardless of how far along the (asylum) procedure is – can apply to be in the MORE program.,
950,The JKU’s International Welcome Center and Ombudsman Office for Students has been involved in the MORE initiative since 2020.,
951,"When the program began, it focused more on helping refugees learn German.",
952,"Over time, the initiative has evolved to a two-pillar model for those who have a refugee background or displaced status and would like to earn a degree at the JKU (MOREclassic for students in the pre-study program and the Borealis-MORE grant and scholarship for degree-seeking students).",
953,"The IWC as a Center for Displaced Ukrainian Students As part of the MORE initiative, the IWC also coordinates and organizes the JKUs outreach efforts for displaced Ukrainian students.",
954,"The IWC has created a landing page (https://www.jku.at/en/international-welcome-center-and-student-ombuds-office/jku-linz-for-ukrainian-displaced-people/) to provide information regarding issues related to residency, housing and studies.",
955,Information on the page is available in three languages.,
956,"In close cooperation with the JKU’s International Office, the mobility program also provides easier, fast-track access to admission for the 2022 Summer Semester.",
957,"In cooperation with the Center for Business Languages and Intercultural Communications at JKU, the IWC has also organized German language courses for displaced Ukrainian students.",
958,The language courses will help the students wishing to earn a degree acquire the language skills they need in order to be admitted to the JKU Linz as degree-seeking students.,

960,Tourism in the age of climate change - is it even worth it?,
961,And how successfully can we support sustainable tourism?,
962,"Andreas Straube wearing a VR headset Endowed with €1.1 million, a six-year Interreg project titled Lebenswerter Alpenraum under the management of the Johannes Kepler University Linz will address these questions and more, questions that are of particular importance to a leading tourist destination such as Austria.",
963,Interreg is a joint initiative by the European Regional Development Fund.,
964,"Under the direction of Dr. Herta Neiß (Tourism Management at the JKU’s Institute for Social and Economic History), Lebenswerter Alpenraum aims to create participatory solutions to support sustainable tourism in the German-Austrian alpine region.",
965,"The cross-border partnership with various project partners (Salzburg University of Applied Sciences - Mario Jooss, Rosenheim University of Technology - Andreas Straube, hublz - Barbara Pölzleithner, hey.bayern - Hans Wembacher, Chiemgau Tourismus - Stephan Semmelmayr, Inner Salzkammergut Tourism Association - Christan Schirlbauer, Cultural Capital 2024 - Stefan Heinisch, Salzkammergut Tourismus und Marketing Ltd. - Michael Spechtenhauser, and Upper Austrian Tourismus - Doris Rom) has been going strong for over three years.",
966,Community InvolvementDr.,
967,"Herta Neiß remarked: We need to develop innovative approaches that will not only create solutions to address more sustainable tourism developments, but also focus culturally on regions included in the study (Upper Austria, Salzburg and Bavaria).",
968,The regional population’s needs should align with tourism developments.,
969,"As part of our workshops and a large-scale survey, we aim to learn more about what the local population wants so we can incorporate this information into the project.",
970,"Different Regions, Similar Challenges The participating regions have a somewhat comparable baseline of a high volume of tourism and selective peak times.",
971,The goal is to overcome these challenges by expanding existing attractions and making them more interesting and appealing.,
972,"One of many new ideas would be to add new types of experiences and present them on a digital, interactive platform.",
973,"In an effort to promote travel to the respective regions, the digital platform could feature, for example, 360° videos, interactive games, or even augmented reality applications to take visitors through virtual worlds as avatars.",
974,Dr. Neiß added: We want to tap into new groups of guests and get them more interested in visiting the participating regions.,
975,The idea is to make tourism more resilient in the face of random events.,
976,The partners plan to launch their ideas during a major symposium scheduled for the fall of 2023 in the Salzkammergut regions and in cooperation with the 2024 Capital of Culture.,
977,"The symposium will address tourism volume, peak times, as well as introduce some of innovative, future-oriented approaches to finding solutions.

978,What would you like to study?,
979,Faculty and students at the JKU’s Open House answered these questions and more!,
980,"Impression from the 2023 Open House Interest in the JKU’s Open House was tremendous and the university welcomed around 1,000 visitors to the Kepler Hall for the first time since the start of the pandemic.",
981,Choosing the right degree program can be difficult and over 300 people took advantage of the opportunity to take a free study assessment test.,
982,"The guided tours were also popular as 70 prospective students took part in three mechatronics tours alone, and 250 participants took a general campus tour to get to know the JKU better.",
983,"Faculty members and students enrolled at the JKU were on-hand to answer visitors’ questions about undergraduate, graduate, and Diploma degree programs.",
984,"The program also featured a variety of events, ranging from demonstrations by robot dog SPOT to free nitrogen ice cream, a social media lounge and basketball performances by the JKU Astros.

987,How exactly do you write an academic text?,
988,"Info sessions and workshops during the “Long Night of Writing” not only provided tips and suggestions on writing academic papers, but also offered fun events to break up the evening, including yoga sessions, back exercise classes, and juggling!",
989,"One June 28 between 5:30 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning, over 100 students came to the JKU’s Learning Center to share advice and write together.",

1007,"Wolfgang Högler, Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine February 28 is Rare Disease Day.",
1008,"Rare does not mean just low in number: approximately 7% of the population are affected by the 7,000 rare diseases known at present, meaning that throughout Europe, some 30 million people are affected.",
1009,Researchers and physicians at the Johannes Kepler University and the Kepler University Hospital are currently conducting ground-breaking research to treat these types of diseases.,
1010,The Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine was established in 2018 at the Kepler University Hospital and department head Prof. Wolfgang Högler’s activities include conducting research and treating rare diseases.,
1011,"Patients affected by rare diseases experience an enormous amount of psychological stress and strain, not only during the period leading up to the diagnosis, but afterwards as well.",
1012,"In addition, the more unusual and rarer a disease is, the more expensive treatment can be and spending several hundreds and thousands of euros annually per patient is not uncommon.",
1013,"Leading hospitals in Europe and in the EU itself have long understood that patients suffering from a rare disease can really only be treated at specialized centers where there is a higher level of expertise, healthcare professionals with years of extensive training and education in that particular field, as well as active involvement in globally networked research projects.",
1014,"Professor Högler spent 13 years at leading endocrinology institutions in English-speaking countries before accepting his appointment to Linz and remarked: Thanks to advanced technologies in DNA/RNA sequencing, diagnostics have improved greatly.",
1015,"When it comes to complex cases, our research network and my research laboratory at the JKU’s new Faculty of Medicine campus gives us opportunities to dive even further into the genetical material to look for causes or track down the disease mechanisms.",
1016,"This kind of research has paved the way to developing many new types of treatment; there are wonderful examples of enzyme replacement therapies and, more recently, gene therapy, all of which are experiencing success on a revolutionary scale.",
1017,Experts in Prof. Högler’s team in Linz are part of internationally active networks that aim to give as many patients as possible access to studies as well as new treatment options.,
1018,"As part of the European Reference Network for Rare Diseases, doctors and nurses work in specialized teams.",
1019,"One example of a rare disease is hypophosphatasia (HPP), a hereditary, incurable bone metabolism disorder in which the bones lack sufficient mineral content, leading to severe skeletal malformations.",
1020,"Patients suffer from rickets, bone fractures, muscle weakness, fatigue, rheumatic pain, and the early loss of baby teeth, including the root.",
1021,"Approximately 1 in 7,000 experience a moderate or mild form of HPP.",
1022,"The more severe the disease, the earlier it tends to manifest and the earlier it can be diagnosed.",
1023,"Diagnosing HPP includes a blood test and an X-ray, however, genetic testing is crucial as the disease is caused by mutations in the ALPL gene.",
1024,The problem is that the ALPL gene has a large number of variants and the extent of the disease can sometimes be unclear.,
1025,This is where Prof. Högler’s research comes in.,
1026,"The JKU website features a global, publicly accessible site that lists all of the known ALPL gene variants.",
1027,This particular database serves as a reference for experts from around the world who are involved in treating this disease.,
1028,"The project team in Linz receives the genetic codes for ALPL variants from around the world, conducts cell-culture testing to determine disease value, and presents the findings to an international group of experts led by Prof. Högler.",
1029,"The database includes all of the information published about the gene variant’s disease value to date, ranging from cell function to the patients’ corresponding symptoms.",
1030,"By classifying as many gene variants as possible, the idea is to facilitate diagnosing HPP in the future.",
1031,"The project was created by Prof. Högler and laboratory manager Dr. El-Gazzar with funding in the amount of € 1.4 million provided by a biopharmaceutical company, Alexion, which specializes in rare diseases.",
1032,The research findings are expected to provide a better understanding of the disease.,
1033,"Prof. Högler added, Network-based research is essential in an effort to learn more and acquire a greater understanding.",
1034,"Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine in Transition Tremendous advances in diagnostic tools are transforming pediatrics and medical education at the Kepler University Hospital, a place where congenital diseases and metabolic disorders are initially diagnosed and treated.",
1035,"As there are approximately 7,000 rare diseases, creating a central hub as well as specializing in a field are an absolute must in the area of pediatrics; the large number of special outpatient clinics are a testament to the core idea.",
1036,One example of rapid developments in medical care on a university level is epilepsy.,
1037,"Two decades ago, there was little aetiological research in this area and patients simply accepted the diagnosis of epilepsy, focusing more on being seizure-free but without understanding why he",
1038,/she had the disease.,
1039,"In 2022, diagnosing epilepsy has evolved into more than 130 specific clinical pictures, mostly of genetic origin, and each with a specific disease mechanism.",
1040,"The same applies to dwarfism, bone brittleness, and many types of hormonal disorders.",
1041,"Prof. Högler pointed out the challenges and future opportunities: It goes without saying that each of these individual diseases also require tailored treatment plans, and our clinical research within international networks is quite pivotal in order to create and provide individual treatment.",
1042,"Prof. Högler added: As researchers, we have to turn our attention to what was once previously considered inexplicable and also teach these subjects because today\s research are tomorrow’s cures.",
1043,"Main Focus at the University Hospital on Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine The Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine has extensive expertise in the areas of endocrinology (hormones), osteology (bones), and neurology (nervous system and muscles), hereby providing the medical care not only required in this region, but also beyond state borders.",

1070,A JKU study has shown that spending more time with AMS advisors results in finding a job faster.,
1071,"Arbeitssuche Symbolbild; Credit: Pixelbay The Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) provides assistance, support services, and job placement services for those who are unemployed.",
1072,Just how successfully someone can be helped to become employed again also depends on how many job seekers an AMS advisor has to assist.,
1073,"The evaluation for a pilot project is suggesting that a more intensive level of support can shorten the duration of unemployment, speed up the process to find a new job, and save money in the process.",
1074,"In 2015 (2019), the AMS found jobs for an average of approximately 5,230 (5,500) individuals (full-time), serving over 1 million (960,000) individuals and over 68,000 (76,000) companies (AMS, 2015; AMS, 2019).",
1075,"Approximately 11,300 job referrals were issued each working day in 2015 for approximately four million job interviews, and around three-quarters of all job openings (excluding apprenticeships) were filled within a one-month period.",
1076,"In 2015 and in 2016, the AMS piloted an experimental project to explore the impact of more attentive counseling services.",
1077,The number of employees was increased at one regional office in Linz and at one office in Vienna to support a randomly selected group of job seekers; the ratio of support for all other job seekers did not change.,
1078,"At the start of the project in Vienna, one person in one group provided support services for approximately 100 unemployed individuals.",
1079,"In the comparison group (in which the staffing level remained unchanged), one person provided support services for approximately 250 unemployed individuals.",
1080,The advisors who provided services to the smaller group therefore had more time to assist the job seekers.,
1081,"An evaluation by JKU labor market economist, René Böheim, along with Helmut Mahringer and Rainer Eppel (both WIFO), has shown that improving the support ratio has initially resulted in more extensive counseling services and job placement activities, thereby positively impacting the job seekers’ employment opportunities.",
1082,"The advisors had more time to spend with individual job seekers, resulting in more frequent contact, more job offers, more allocation to support different measures, but also more frequent suspension of receiving benefit if the individual did not keep interview appointments or rejected job offers.",
1083,"In comparing the labor market situation two years after the project began, the group with better support services was registered as unemployed for an average of two months less than those in the group with the unchanged support service ratio.",
1084,The shorter unemployment period was partly due to the fact that the unemployed individuals who had more support were able to find a job more quickly.,
1085,"In addition, the unemployment rate impacted the number of those who gave up unemployment benefits without having found a job, meaning they remained without gainful employment and did not receive any benefits to secure their livelihood, such as unemployment benefits or unemployment assistance.",
1086,"In theory, a higher level of support could result in some individuals accepting less attractive jobs in order to avoid having to check in with the advisor often and being subject to a certain extent of “control” that comes with the process.",
1087,"This could potentially result in a higher degree of more unstable employment, or comparatively low pay, because employees and employers are not as well matched.",
1088,"On the other hand, more coordinated placement could result in more stable, higher-paying employment if the labor force was more closely matched to the job opening.",
1089,"However, the greater intensity of outreach actually had no impact on either entry-level wages or job length.",
1090,"This indicates that while the more closely supervised group found a job more quickly, the nature of employment did not change substantially.",
1091,"A comparison of the costs to provide a higher level of support services and the revenues for the public sector has shown that increasing the number of employees not only helped many jobseekers find employment more quickly, but it is also more cost-efficient.",
1092,The higher staffing costs are outweighed by the fact that shorter unemployment periods result in fewer subsistence benefits and finding a job faster boosts revenue from taxes and social security contributions.,
1093,"In this case, this is an investment that can actually save the state money.",

1587,"In an effort to facilitate tangible research breakthroughs, the “ELLIS Machine Learning for Molecule Discovery Program” connects European hubs that focus on AI research.",
1588,"Coordinated by the ELLIS Unit at the JKU (head: Prof. Sepp Hochreiter), academic experts and scholars at universities (such as Oxford, Cambridge, and ETH Zurich) have joined experts at institutions such as the Berlin Charité, and corporations, such as AstraZeneca, to share expertise, experience, and even computer codes.",
1589,This is one of two new ELLIS programs that have now been approved.,
1590,Enabling Concrete Applications Prof. Günter Klambauer (Institute for Machine Learning) explains: Each of the partners is conducting their own AI system research to support a specific purpose in molecular research.,
1591,"Here at the JKU, we are now coordinating the network’s in-depth exchange.",
1592,But what does this mean in concrete terms?,
1593,"Klambauer added: For example, our partners at Microsoft Research in Cambridge put together a program where – with just a few clues - you have to find molecules that have certain biochemical properties.",
1594,We took this dataset and used it to develop an AI system that can quite accurately solve these problems.,
1595,"Although it is standard industry practice to publish data sets and program codes, … that\s not the end of the story.",
1596,"The mutual exchange is invaluable, creating an open conversation about what worked and what didn\t, as well as supporting direct application approaches.",
1597,Everyone benefits from a sense of mutual trust that supports shortening the developmental processes and avoiding missteps.,
1598,"AI pioneer Sepp Hochreiter remarked: Each ELLIS partner is continuing to work in his or her area of expertise, but if anyone runs into obstacles or needs to solve a general problem, that person can draw on the expertise and experience of scientists throughout Europe.",
1599,"The “Few Shots” Method is Revolutionizing AI ELLIS partners are currently working on various issues in areas that include drug development, climate change, the global food crisis and - at the JKU – molecules, along with AI that is capable of predicting the molecules’ effects, properties, and activities.",
1600,"The JKU’s efforts extend further, however, by developing a new “Few-Shot Learning Method”, meaning that instead of feeding each new AI system with large amounts of data from scratch, it builds on existing AIs (and their learning and knowledge), attempting to effectively apply a prior understanding to address new problems.",
1601,"Klambauer elaborated: In simpler terms, it means taking a pyramid that is already there and just having to design the small capstone yourself.",
1602,"The approach is much more efficient, saving an enormous number of computing years.",
1603,"JKU Rector Meinhard Lukas is particularly pleased about the start of the new ELLIS program: “When it comes to molecular research, this program is revolutionary and the JKU is driving force behind this European initiative.",
1604,"We shouldn’t leave technological progress to major powers or corporations, but rather, as a European community of values, we should be helping to shape it.",
1605,"We can be proud of the fact that the JKU is a strong, active part of this initiative.”

",
1763,"On behalf of the emperor: In 1878 women were admitted to Austrian universities, but – as documented at the time – only by exception.",
1764,Alberta Bonanni; photo credit: JKU/Maybach What seems like so long time ago is really not that long ago at all.,
1765,"Following a petition to Emperor Franz Joseph in 1895, the Austrian Ministry of the Interior recognized Gabriele Possanner von Ehrenthal\s Swiss medical degree, thus allowing her to practice medicine.",
1766,"In 1907, Elise Richter, a Romance scholar, became the first woman to receive a post-doctorate/habilitation at the University of Vienna.",
1767,"She was able to do so in lieu of a decree issued by the Austrian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs on May 6, 1878, which, for the first time, admitted women to university courses, however only on exception and only in special circumstances to be appreciated in an individual case.",
1768,"While the ideals from back then make people shake their heads today, this also raises the question: After 144 years since women have been able to attend university in Austria, what is it like for women in science?",
1769,"Today at the JKU, there are more women enrolled than men (12,523 to 11,805).",
1770,"However, when it comes to academic faculty, the situation is different:",
1771,"In this regard, only 37% are female.",
1772,"Among professors, the proportion of women is only 17.71%.",
1773,"The rate is, however, increasing as ten years ago, the proportion of women among academic faculty was 34%, and among professors just 14.41%.",
1774,Is this reason for celebration or concern?,
1775,"Alberta Bonanni, JKU Vice-Rector for Research, Gender and Diversity, gives us some of her thoughts.",
1776,Do you consider days like Women in Science Day” important?,
1777,Prof. Alberta Bonanni: I believe they are very important because they remind us that we still have a long way to go and collective efforts are the way to move forward.,
1778,What is the current landscape for women scientists like at the JKU?,
1779,Prof. Alberta Bonanni:,
1780,The situation depends very much on the subject area.,
1781,There are very large gender gaps in certain subject areas.,
1782,"The issues of gender and diversity are a main priority at the JKU and we are confident that by continually increasing awareness at all levels and by practicing targeted initiatives, we can move quickly towards an egalitarian, inclusive and more equal landscape.",
1783,How difficult was your journey to pursue science?,

1787,MoonDream & PlanetSound - a shadow theater performance about the life and times of Johannes Kepler delighted audiences at the Circus of Knowledge.,
1788,A scene from the shadow theater performance; photo credit: Nick Mangafas The first season ended on a brilliant note and circus director Airan Berg can head into the summer with a successful balance sheet.,
1789,"The JKU\s namesake played a special role at the Circus of Knowledge between May 19 and 25 as the shadow theater piece, MoonDream & PlanetSound, whisking 570 students (27 school classes) into Johannes Kepler’s world.",
1790,"Produced especially for the Circus of Knowledge, director Martina Winkel and Upper Austrian puppeteer Andreas Pfaffenberger’s premiere of “MoonDream & PlanetSound” was a visual showpiece that took visitors from the ages of 8+ on a fantastic journey through time to recount the natural scientist and polymath’s life and work.",
1791,"Students Fascinated with the Shadow Theater Performance Following the enthusiastic response, this morning at 11:00 AM there was another special performance for a number of students from the VS 12 Otto-Glöckel School in Linz and the VS Eidenberg.",
1792,JKU Rector Meinhard Lukas joined the students during the performance and was impressed: \MoonDream & PlanetSound\ is a fantastic production that transports you back to the life and times of our university\s namesake.,
1793,"This is a piece that both entertains and sparks curiosity, inviting us to discover the world of science.",
1794,"The response from students and teachers has been extremely positive, confirming our program at the Circus of Knowledge and motivating us to continue developing our program along these lines.",
1795,I look forward to the fall and to many new productions and collaboration efforts.,
1796,"Looking Back on a Positive Year Following the successful season finale, circus director Airan Berg positively assessed the first season of performances: I am very pleased with the current response.",
1797,"The opening performances featuring TEXTA, Anne Bennent and Klaus Maria Brandauer in April pulled the crowd in.",
1798,"We tried different formats out, experience taught us a number of things, and we also realized the potential when bringing art, science and society together.",
1799,But we are only at the beginning.,
1800,The challenge now is to gradually increase awareness about the Circus of Knowledge among the resident in Linz.,
1801,"We have such a unique space here at the JKU and the diverse program is not only an asset for the campus, but for all of Linz as well, and perhaps beyond the city limits.",
1802,A Few Highlights Between April and July 2022: The Circus of Knowledge will present its schedule for the upcoming season in September with performances scheduled to begin in early October.,
1803,"While the details have not yet been released, Airan Berg hints: I look forward to more intensive and engaging dialogue between artists, academics, and scientists and more interaction with the audience.",
1804,"And, of course, I look forward to the unknown and unexpected because the circus is - and will remain - a space full of surprises.",
1805,A special focus will continue on programs for school-age children and school classes in the fall.,

1811,Swiss actress Anne Bennent read powerful diary entries written by Ukrainians in the war zone.,
1812,The legendary Linz hip-hop band TEXTA captivated the audience with its social criticism wrapped in good beats and a strong sense of humor.,
1813,"Austrian actor and director Klaus Maria Brandauer recited selected texts about war, peace and democracy.",
1814,"Airan Berg, director at the Circus of Knowledge, remarked: By definition, art is political and - in addition to our primary mission to bring art and science together at the Circus of Knowledge - we will also always speak out on current issues.",
1815,"I would like to thank the fantastic artists who have agreed to perform in support of the important MORE initiative and, by waiving their fees, they have made this successful fundraiser possible.",
1816,"We would like to thank all of the engaged and supportive audience members whose voluntary contributions helped to raise approximately € 3,700 to benefit the MORE initiative in support of refugee students and displaced students.",
1817,"MORE supports this group of people financially as well as through providing academic advising services, information events, and organizing language courses.",
1818,"Sonja Falkner-Matzinger, program manager of the MORE initiative, added: I appreciate the strong collaboration with the Circus of Knowledge and on behalf of the students in the MORE program, I would like to thank everyone for their donations!",

",
1820,"Each year, approximately ten people are sentenced to life in Austria.",
1821,"At present, some 150 prisoners are currently serving life sentences.",
1822,Professor Helmut Hirtenlehner,
1823,But – in Austria - just how long is really lifelong?,
1824,Surprisingly little research had been done to answer this question.,
1825,"Two researchers at the Johannes Kepler University Linz have, however, now addressed the issue.",
1826,Univ.,
1827,"Prof. Alois Birklbauer (JKU Institute of Criminal Law) referred to the Criminal Code and remarked: By law, a life sentence does not necessarily mean being imprisoned until one dies.",
1828,Conditional release is an option once 15 years have been served.,
1829,"At this point, the authorities must determine whether or not the prison inmate can be released.",
1830,"Later, a prisoner can also apply to be released on conditional parole.",
1831,Univ.,
1832,"Prof. Helmut Hirtenlehner (Institute for Procedural Justice) explains: If approved, this is followed by a probationary ten-year period.",
1833,"Additional conditions may also be imposed, such as an alcohol ban or mandatory psychotherapy.",
1834,"The two criminal law experts set out to find out just how long life in prison really is in Austria, including the factors that influence the court\s decision to release a prisoner.",
1835,"On Average, A Life Sentence is 21 Years",
1836,The two scholars analyzed 140 files.,
1837,"Of those sentenced to life in prison, 96% were men and murder accounted for 99% of the lifelong sentences.",
1838,"On average, each person had five release proceedings, meaning that a total of approximately 700 court rulings were reviewed.",
1839,"The findings are that in Austria, a life sentence seldom means until death.",
1840,The average prison term is 21 years.,
1841,"Birklbauer remarked: Twenty years into their sentence, 56% of those sentenced to life in prison remain in prison.",
1842,"25 years after sentencing, the number of prisoners drops to 27%, and by the 30th year after sentencing, it drops to 17%.",
1843,"33 years after sentencing, 10% of the \lifers\ are still in prison.",
1844,"More Severity in Sex Killing Cases Although this means that in general a prisoner can be released from a life sentence, it rarely happens swiftly.",
1845,Less than 5% of lifers are released after serving a minimum of 15 years.,
1846,Hirtenlehner added: The highest probability of being released is after serving between 17 to 23 years.,
1847,The prospects regarding conditional release do not apply equally to everyone.,
1848,Individuals whose sentences are based on having committed a sexual homicide have the lowest chances of being released.,
1849,"Prisoners with prior convictions and prison sentences before their current incarceration are also less likely to be released, or they will be released later.",
1850,The Public Prosecutors Office is Influential What moves the court to grant a release?,
1851,The convicted prisoner’s odds of a positive outcome are around 20%.,
1852,The public prosecutors office can greatly influence the outcome.,
1853,The public prosecutor can appeal against conditional release and courts tend to support the public prosecutors stance.,
1854,", It turns out that during the release proceedings, psychiatric and psychological experts are only sporadically consulted.",
1855,"If a current expert report is commissioned (but this hardly happens in even half of the number of cases), they could majorly influence the courts decision-making process.,",
1856,"During release proceedings, prisoners are rarely represented by attorneys (in fact, in only 10% of the proceedings).",
1857,"Oddly enough, this does not actually benefit prisoners.",
1858,"When lifers have legal counsel, there is a likelihood that a new, updated expert report will be commissioned.",
1859,"During the evaluation process, the majority of these reports, however, may not be to the prisoner’s advantage.",
1860,The result is that legal assistance does not necessarily support the release process.,
1861,Austrian Law Complies with Human Rights,
1862,"A life sentence can only comply with fundamental and human rights providing the prisoner has a realistic prospect of being released during his or her lifetime, and given a justifiable assessment of being no danger to the public.",
1863,"Accordingly, the Austrian legal system - which grants lifers a prospect of release after serving 15 years - complies with these requirements.",
1864,The fact that courts grant paroled release is testament to the fact that practices are compatible with these rights.,
1865,"The study’s two authors add: One should, however, question the considerable influence the public prosecutor\s office has on the court\s actual release decisions, especially when compared to testimony provided by the authorities where the prisoners had been housed.",
1866,The institutions are more familiar with the inmates than the public prosecutor\s office.,
1867,"Psychiatric reports about the prisoner’s relapse risk are also rarely commissioned, resulting in relying all too often on old, outdated reports.",
1868,"If commissioned, updated expert reports could, however, greatly influence the court’s decision-making process.",
1869,"Both Birklbauer and Hirtenlehner added: Overall, the courts could consider reviewing more early release cases, providing the future outlook is positive, and especially as Austria already has very high prison rates compared to other European countries.",
1870,"In criminological literature, the relapse rates by those sentenced to life is reported to be comparatively low.",
1871,The JKU’s Research Focus on Procedural Justice Analyses like these are part of a new research focus at the JKU Faculty of Law.,
1872,"Under the term Procedural Justice, faculty members and legal scholars focus on studying legal decision-making procedures, whereby both legal and empirical issues are the subject of consideration.
",
1873,JKU researchers recently began using glossy paint fungus skin (Ganoderma lucidum) as a substrate for electronic components.,
1874,MycelioTronics in electronics.,
1875,Scientists have dubbed the new innovative substance MycelioTronics and Martin Kaltenbrunner (Department of Soft Matter Physics at the JKU) believes it’s a global first that could result in more sustainable electronics.,
1876,"At any rate, the fungal skin is an “ingenious barrier”.",
1877,"As described in the journal Science Advances under the leadership of the studys first authors Doris Danninger and Roland Pruckner, the approach was more or less an accidental discovery, … as is so often the case when it comes to science, remarked Kaltenbrunner.",
1878,"He added that the institute has focused on the topic of fungi for some time now but more in other contexts, such as insulation in the construction industry and using mycelium materials as an alternative to Styrofoam.",
1879,"As part of a new study, the team (which has made waves in recent years thanks to many new developments in robotics and electronics) also looked at applying fungi to support sustainable electronics.",
1880,"Kaltenbrunner explained that scientists discovered that in order to protect itself from pathogens and other fungi, glossy paint fungus forms a closed mycelium skin on the surface of its growing medium.",
1881,It turns out that this skin can be easily removed then processed further.,
1882,Scientists can even use the skin directly for a project; it just needs to be dried.,
1883,"The skin could be used, for example.",
1884,as a flexible printed circuit board … to manufacture electronics atop of it.,
1885,"Kaltenbrunner added, “…producing the pulp, however, is energy-intensive and not really sustainable.",
1886,The mushroom skins only need waste wood to grow.,
1887,"The materials robust, flexible, and heat resistant properties could potentially become a polymer substitute for polymers currently used in making flexible electronic components.",
1888,"Kaltenbrunner explained that all types of printed circuit boards are made out of composite materials that are generally difficult to separate, recycle, or decompose.",
1889,"This biodegradable mushroom skin, however, is now emerging as a true alternative.,",
1890,"As an initial step, Linz researchers envision physical applications, such as in the field of medical technology, where these kinds of components need to primarily work for periods of up to a year.",
1891,"We have created proximity and humidity sensors, for example, and they also work well.",
1892,The scientist made them by soldering relatively conventional electronic chips onto the mycelium substrate.,
1893,"Incidentally, he added, the fungal skin is also surprisingly heat-resistant, able to withstand temperatures of up to 250°C.",
1894,This is an important factor when building circuits.,
1895,"When it comes to developing new types of batteries that consist mainly of mycelium, this material is interesting as it can wirelessly power electronics.",
1896,Scientists have already begun to pursue initial approaches and are now trying to adapt the membrane properties formed by fungal skin to various applied ideas.,
1897,One key would be to make the naturally grown structure even more homogeneous and ultimately place the electronics on top of it; they would be just as biodegradable as the carrier material.,
1898,"Kaltenbrunner added: That would then be the next step and for that, the surface would have to be even smoother.

1900,Data glasses So-called “data glasses” are allowing surgeons to virtually superimpose radiological images on to actual patients.,
1901,"In the future, state-of-the-art technology made in Upper Austria will provide neurosurgeons with even better insight into the brain.",
1902,Prof. Dr. Andreas Gruber (head of the Department of Neurosurgery and Dean of Research at the JKU’s Faculty of Medicine) initiated a research partnership with cortEXplore in 2019.,
1903,Looking at the brain and blood vessels prior to surgery Neurosurgeon Priv.,
1904,Doz.,
1905,"Dr. Matthias Gmeiner used the system for the first time and described the advantages: These glasses give me an opportunity to look directly at the patient’s brain and the blood vessels in 3D during surgery, even before the procedure.",
1906,"The Linz-based, start-up company, cortEXplore, is providing the navigational technology used during the studies.",
1907,"The company focuses on digitalizing the ‘operating room of the future’ and company representatives added: In the future, surgeons and supporting technologies will merge even more effectively in the operating room.",
1908,State-of-the-art technology made in Upper Austria Professor Andreas Gruber also pointed out: Neurosurgery is one of only a handful of medical disciplines that depend on medical advancements in technology.,
1909,"Thanks to outstanding innovation in this field, we can support medical advancement and increase patient safety.",
1910,"The fact that the applied technology was developed by an Upper Austrian company, whose director conducted research on this procedure at Rockefeller University in New York himself, further reinforces the way Linz is growing a university medical center.

2309,Individuals whose sentences are based on having committed a sexual homicide have the lowest chances of being released., 0;;;;
2310,The Public Prosecutors Office is Influential What moves the court to grant a release?, 0;;;;
2311,The convicted prisoner’s odds of a positive outcome are around 20%., 0;;;;
2312,The public prosecutors office can greatly influence the outcome., 0;;;;
2313,The public prosecutor can appeal against conditional release and courts tend to support the public prosecutors stance., 0;;;;
2314,The result is that legal assistance does not necessarily support the release process., 0;;;;
2315,The fact that courts grant paroled release is testament to the fact that practices are compatible with these rights., 0;;;;
2316,The institutions are more familiar with the inmates than the public prosecutor\s office., 0;;;;

2320,Scientists have dubbed the new innovative substance MycelioTronics and Martin Kaltenbrunner (Department of Soft Matter Physics at the JKU) believes it’s a global first that could result in more sustainable electronics., 0;;;;
2321,It turns out that this skin can be easily removed then processed further., 0;;;;
2322,Scientists can even use the skin directly for a project; it just needs to be dried., 0;;;
2323,as a flexible printed circuit board … to manufacture electronics atop of it., 0;;;;
2324,The mushroom skins only need waste wood to grow., 0;;;;
2325,The scientist made them by soldering relatively conventional electronic chips onto the mycelium substrate., 0;;;;
2326,This is an important factor when building circuits., 0;;;;
2327,Scientists have already begun to pursue initial approaches and are now trying to adapt the membrane properties formed by fungal skin to various applied ideas., 0;;;;
2328,One key would be to make the naturally grown structure even more homogeneous and ultimately place the electronics on top of it; they would be just as biodegradable as the carrier material., 0;;;
2329,The Department of Neurosurgery (NeuroMed Campus at the Kepler University Hospital) is currently testing new guided brain surgery technology., 0;;;;

2356,The innovation offensive itself was to be funded in equal parts by the state and the higher education institutions in Lower Saxony., 0;;;;
2357,Ten innovation projects were set up at the University of Hannover with the emphasis on science and engineering., 0;;;;
2358,Both Council and Senate delivered opinions on this., 0;;;;
2359,The new bachelor’s and master’s degrees could soon be taken in many subjects., 0;;;;
2360,The university started the accreditation of new degree programmes., 0;;;;
2361,State and university regulate their relationship through target agreements according to the principles of new public management., 0;;;;
2362,It was modified in 2007., 0;;;;
2363,The university remained a public corporation with the right to self-government., 0;;;;
2364,The Council was dissolved., 0;;;;

2368,The President is nominated or designated on the advice of the Senate., 0;;;;
2369,The Senate submits its proposal together with a statement from the University Council to the Lower Saxony Minister of Science and Culture., 0;;;;
2370,This optimization concept led to far-reaching restructuring of higher education in Lower Saxony., 0;;;;
2371,The Department of Law remained as a legal training institute but without the social science specialisation., 0;;;;
2372,The Department of Romance Studies was phased out in its then form and reopened in 2012 with Spanish Studies., 0;;;;

2376,The number of subjects taught doubled between 1875 and 1897., 0;;;;
2377,New areas such as shipbuilding were introduced., 0;;;;
2378,The academic staff grew accordingly., 0;;;;
2379,On 1st April 1879 the Polytechnic was awarded the official title “Hannover Royal Institute of Technology.”., 0;;;;
2380,The Rector was elected for a three-year term of office., 0;;;;

2388,In 1930 the National Socialist Students received 11.8%., 0;;;;
2389,Almost a quarter of these were to die in the course of the war., 0;;;;
2390,The division of higher education into universities and institutes of technology that had been drawn up in the 19th century was seen as a mistake., 0;;;;
2391,Here students of the different disciplines were to work alongside and with each other., 0;;;;
2392,The sciences and the arts were to complement and stimulate each other., 0;;;;
2393,A step in this direction was to introduce the same organisational structures to the institutes of technology and the universities., 0;;;;
2394,For the institutes of technology this meant dissolving the departments that had existed so far and setting up faculties., 0;;;;
2395,The following three faculties were introduced on 1st July 1922 at Hannover Institute of Technology:, 0;;;;
2396,Professorships were not set up here and lectures were held by Privatdozente (private lecturers)., 1;;;;
2397,The transfer of responsibility for the institutes of technology from the Department of Trade to the Department of Education paved the way for transition from a specialised institute to a broader scientific institution., 0;;;;
2398,The 1880s and 1890s were marked by a rapid expansion of technology and industry., 0;;;;
2399,The institutes of technology were faced with the problem of modifying their curriculum in order to keep pace with fast-changing technical developments in industry., 0;;;;

2402,This was the final step towards acquiring equal status with the universities., 0;;;;
2403,It became a Prussian province., 0;;;;
2404,Prussian legislation led to substantial liberalisation., 0;;;;
2405,The downside of advancing industrialisation was an increase in social problems., 0;;;;
2406,In 1869 Hannover Polytechnic was granted the right to offer the corresponding higher level courses and to conduct the state exams for Regierungsbauführer and Regierungsbaumeister (government foreman and government architect)., 1;;;;
2407,The general trend at technical colleges towards placing engineering on a more scientific footing was not pursued under the aegis of Karmarsch., 0;;;;
2408,The director was not elected; the school was headed by a “permanent director”., 0;;;
2409,Karl Karmarsch’s 44 year incumbency ended in 1875., 0;;;;
2410,A one-year preparatory school had been introduced at the polytechnic in 1847., 0;;;;
2411,The number of subjects taught tripled between 1845 and 1853., 0;;;;
2412,The library built up by Karl Karmarsch could soon measure up to other similar institutions., 0;;;;
2413,The chemistry laboratory set up by Friedrich Heeren in 1854/55 was regarded as one of the largest and most modern in the whole of Germany., 0;;;;
2414,Hannover was growing rapidly at that time., 0;;;;
2415,Hannover’s industrial development was mainly in the adjoining town of Linden., 0;;;;
2416,The initiative aims to combine the potential of all partners in order to develop a quantum computer based on ion trap technology while bringing together excellent research projects as well as the expertise available across various locations in Lower Saxony., 0;;;;
2417,Building a quantum computer in such a short period of time is an ambitious project., 0;;;;
2418,These ions are trapped using electric fields and subsequently controlled via radio waves and laser beams., 0;;;;
2419,This technology is considered one of the most promising approaches for realising a quantum computer with significant computing power., 0;;;;
2420,This will enable efficient generation of large entangled states between quantum bits (photons) and/or matter quantum bits (quantum dots)., 0;;;;
2421,The development of such integrated devices enables the operation of many parallel semiconductor systems on a single chip., 0;;;;
2422,A mobile vaccination team of Region Hannover will administer vaccinations between 10.00 and 17.00 in room A320 of the main university building (Welfengarten 1)., 0;;;;

2426,Unvaccinated persons that have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be vaccinated no earlier than 3 months after their recovery., 0;;;;
2427,Vaccinations will be available between 10.00 (time has been updated since the initial announcement) and 17.00., 0;;;;
2428,This is possible due to the 3G rule: Anyone accessing LUH buildings must provide proof of full vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of recovery., 0;;;;
2429,The project aims to achieve an ambitious goal: developing an innovative quantum computer based on high-frequency controlled ions., 0;;;;
2430,The project is scheduled to be completed within four years., 0;;;;
2431,With Quantum Valley Lower Saxony - the quantum alliance based in Lower Saxony - we are already deeply involved in the development of this future-oriented technology., 0;;;;
2432,Quantum parallelism is a key feature of quantum computers and enables them to solve complex problems efficiently that basically remain unsolvable for the best bit-based supercomputers., 0;;;;
2433,The module can be used for scaling an efficient quantum computer to up to a thousand qubits without switching technologies., 0;;;;
2434,The patented microfabrication procedures developed at Leibniz University Hannover and PTB play a key role in this endeavour., 0;;;;
2435,A quantum computer based on trapped ions can be pictured as a large freight depot., 0;;;;
2436,The tracks of this depot are formed via electrical fields located above the microchips., 0;;;;
2437,A quantum processor is equipped with registers in order to prepare qubits for solving arithmetic operations., 0;;;;

2441,The project is in receipt of funding amounting to 3 million euros provided by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the context of an initiative focusing on application networks for quantum computing., 0;;;;
2442,Chinese and German colleagues often handle innovation processes quite differently., 0;;;;
2443,The new research collaboration TraKuLa (transcultural approaches to skills development and teaching) at Leibniz University Hannover (LUH) intends to analyse which factors lead to successful or unsuccessful outcomes in mutual knowledge transfer in the context of collaborative engineering projects in research and innovation conducted between German and Chinese partners., 0;;;;
2444,Which new insights may be gained through transcultural collaboration?, 0;;;;
2445,How are innovation processes handled in Germany and China?, 0;;;;
2446,How can the capacity for collaboration of German partners be adapted in order to enable them to implement collaborations with partners outside of western cultural environments in an effective and efficient manner?, 0;;;;
2447,Such projects often face difficulties when it comes to managing learning and collaboration processes together and in an efficient manner., 0;;;;
2448,The collaborative project intends to gain a better understanding of the impact of these obstacles while exploring the potential of collaborations between Chinese and German partners., 0;;;;
2449,The event is scheduled to take place in spring 2021., 0;;;;
2450,Many issues in these areas cannot be solved with conventional computational architecture - even with computing power that might be available in the future - and can only be tackled with quantum computers., 0;;;;
2451,The efficiency of a quantum computer is therefore determined by the error rate of the qubits., 0;;;;

2502,"The field of activity at Hannover Institute of Technology expanded in 1951 with the creation of a Department of Shipbuilding in the tradition of the former Danzig Institute of Technology, and in 1952 with the integration of the College of Horticulture and Land Culture as the fourth faculty.",
2503,"In 1954 there were ca 2,900 students at the Institute of Technology.",
2504,"Among them were 103 women and 85 international students from 21 different countries.

2505,Today’s Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität was founded on 2nd May 1831.,
2506,As the Higher Trade School it started its teaching activities with 64 students in the Bornemannsches Haus next to the Marktkirche in the historic city centre.  ,
2507,"Students had to be at least 15 years old if they wished to attend the Higher Trade School, where they would learn a trade.",
2508,"The first director Karl Karmarsch, aged 28, came from the Polytechnic in Vienna and became one of the leading technologists of his time.",
2509,Hannover had been a kingdom since 1814 and was ruled in personal union with Great Britain until 1837.,
2510,"King George IV lived in far-off London, while the popular Adolph Friedrich, Duke of Cambridge, reigned in Hannover.",
2511,It was during his reign that the modernisation of agriculture and the beginnings of industrialisation occurred.,
2512,"Due to the absence of the king, Hannover had remained agricultural; training at the Higher Trade School was to help Hannover to catch up economically and reach the level of industrialisation that was already well underway in Great Britain.",
2513,"Personal Union with Great Britain came to an end in 1837, and the ultra-conservative Ernst August became King in Hannover.	 ",
2514,"His name is associated with the suspension of the state constitution in 1833 and the protest and dismissal of seven Göttingen professors, who became known as the Göttingen Seven.",
2515,"In 1837, the Higher Trade School moved into its own new building in Georgstraße.",
2516,This is where the Kröpcke Centre is today.,
2517,The coming of the railways in 1842 was a major breakthrough for the Higher Trade School.,
2518,Skilled engineers were required for the state railways.,
2519,"The number of students rose sharply, the curriculum was radically altered, and the institution was turned into a polytechnic in 1847.",
2520,Entrance requirements and the age of the polytechnic students were raised.,
2521,"Teaching became more theoretical, mathematical and specialised.
",
2522," 	The death of Benno Ohnesorg, who came from Hannover, in West Berlin on 2nd June 1967 and his funeral in Hannover led to a wave of solidarity on the part of the students.",
2523,"7,000 students took part in a funeral procession, waving black flags as they passed through the city centre; wreaths were laid in the Lichthof of Hannover Institute of Technology.",
2524,"After the silent protest march, the congress “Conditions and Organisation of Resistance” held in Hannover received nationwide attention.",
2525,"Virtually all of the people who played a crucial part in the student movement took part, including Knut Nevermann, Wolfgang Abendroth, Rudi Dutschke and Jürgen Habermas. 	  	",
2526,The best known and most successful campaign within Hannover’s student movement was the red point action in June 1969 against fare increases for public transport in Hannover.,
2527,"Student and school student organisations together with trade unions and other groupings blocked buses and trams while providing alternative, essentially privately-organised public transport in the form of private vehicles marked by a red point on the windscreen.
",
2528," 	When the Lower Saxony Higher Education Act came into force on 1st October 1978, the College of Education for Lower Saxony / Hannover was incorporated, and the Technical University changed its name to the University of Hannover.",
2529,"With the College of Education, the university gained an educational establishment with a long tradition reaching back into the 18th century and associated with the name of Ernst Christoph Böttcher, the founder of the teacher training college in Hannover.",
2530,The integration of the College of Education meant that teacher training in Hannover had at last acquired the status that the teachers associations had been calling for since the 19th century: the incorporation of all teacher training programmes into the university. 	  		,
2531,The university elected its first president on 30th May 1979.,
2532,"One year later the university was restructured according to the Organisation of Higher Education Plan of 1980: 17 departments, 2 faculties and 12 central facilities were created.",
2533,In summer 1982 the university’s charter was approved by the Ministry of Science and Culture. 	  	,
2534,"For the first time, in winter semester 1990 / 91 there were more than 30,000 students registered, 37.4% of them women.",
2535,"In 1995 the university took over the former administration building of the company Continental at Königsworther Platz, the Conti-Campus.",
2536,"With a floor space of 20,000 m², the Departments of Literature and Languages, Law and Economics and Business Management and their departmental libraries could be housed there.",
2537,"The new chemistry building was opened in 1997, and for the engineers the Underwater Technology Centre was inaugurated in Garbsen in June 1997.",
2538,In autumn 1999 Technical Informatics received a new building. 	  	,
2539,In 1997 the Senate passed the university’s Mission Statement.,
2540,"This emphasises the fact that the distinctive character of the university lies in its broad spectrum of disciplines ranging from engineering and natural sciences, aesthetics and planning, law, economics and management, humanities and social sciences and the potential for cooperation that has arisen from this.  		",
2541,"In 1997, five Collaborative Research Centres (CRCs) were established at the university, with participation in two further CRCs.",
2542,In 1999 it was involved in ten CRCs.,
2543,"In this year, third-party funding accounted for 24.5% of the entire university budget.",
2544,70 per cent of third-party funding came from engineering. 	  	,
2545,"Also in 1997, an innovation offensive was signed by the State of Lower Saxony and the State Rectors Conference, in which the state government committed itself to not making any further cuts in the higher education budget for the next five years.",
2546,The innovation offensive itself was to be funded in equal parts by the state and the higher education institutions in Lower Saxony.,
2547,Ten innovation projects were set up at the University of Hannover with the emphasis on science and engineering.,
2548,"In 1999 the Wissenschaftliche Kommission Niedersachsen (WKN) initiated a state-wide procedure to evaluate research.

2550,Both Council and Senate delivered opinions on this.,
2551,The new bachelor’s and master’s degrees could soon be taken in many subjects.,
2552,The university started the accreditation of new degree programmes.	  		,

2560,The Council was dissolved.,
2561,Central organs are the Presidential Committee and the Senate.,
2562,"The Hochschulrat, or University Council, was set up as an advisory body for the Presidential Committee and the Senate.",

2564,It is accountable to the Senate in all matters of self-government within its decision-making competence.,
2565,The President is nominated or designated on the advice of the Senate.,
2566,The Senate submits its proposal together with a statement from the University Council to the Lower Saxony Minister of Science and Culture.<br/>   	In October 2003 the State government passed the Hochschuloptimierungskonzept (HOK).,
2567,This optimization concept led to far-reaching restructuring of higher education in Lower Saxony.,
2568,"Apart from budget cuts and economy measures for the university, there were drastic changes for the University of Hannover’s Department of Education: teacher training for primary schools, Haupt- and Realschulen was transferred to Hildesheim.",
2569,The Department of Law remained as a legal training institute but without the social science specialisation. 	  		,
2570,The Department of Romance Studies was phased out in its then form and reopened in 2012 with Spanish Studies.,
2571,The Diplom and Magister degrees were replaced by bachelor’s and master’s degrees.,
2572,In August 2005 the new university constitution came into force.,
2573,Leibniz Universität is no longer divided into departments but into nine faculties. 	  	,
2574,"1st January 2009 saw the birth of the Niedersächsische Technische Hochschule (Niedersachsen Institutes of Technology, NTH) - an alliance of the three universities Technische Universität Braunschweig, Technische Universität Clausthal and Leibniz Universität Hannover.",
2575,"Its aim is to consolidate existing strengths, thereby increasing efficiency in research and teaching.
",
2576," 	In 1933 the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service came into force, creating the instruments to remove non-Arians and other undesirables from office.",
2577,"At Hannover Institute of Technology only few cleansings are known, as hardly any non-Arians had been appointed.",
2578,"On the initiative of the Institute of Technology, the only full professor to be dismissed was the Professor for Mechanics Otto Flachsbart, who was sent into retirement in June 1937 at the age of 39.",
2579,"His wife was of Jewish origin.
",
2580,The number of subjects taught doubled between 1875 and 1897.,
2581,New areas such as shipbuilding were introduced.,
2582,The academic staff grew accordingly.,
2583,On 1st April 1879 the Polytechnic was awarded the official title “Hannover Royal Institute of Technology.”.,
2584,"With the Institute of Technology’s constitution, which came into force in 1880, one of the major differences between Hannover and the other German technical institutions was removed.",
2585,"The radically new constitution reorganised the Institute of Technology into five specialised departments: Architecture, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry and Electrical Engineering, as well as General Sciences.  Management and administration of the Institute of Technology was in the hands of the departmental staff committees and departmental superintendents; the Senate and the Rector were responsible for the Institute as a whole.",
2586,The Rector was elected for a three-year term of office.  ,
2587,The departmental staff committees as a whole received the right to nominate three candidates for the office of Rector to the Minister.,
2588,"With the right to confer the Habilitation and the title of Privatdozent, the Institute received the full status of an institute of higher education on an equal footing with the universities.",
2589,This was a crucial step for the institutes of technology on the road to equality with the universities.,
2590,"A further crucial step on the road to the emancipation of engineering was the enhanced status that the institutes of technology enjoyed when responsibility for them was transferred from the Department of Trade to the Department of Education, which was also responsible for the universities.",
2591,"From purely technical colleges under the Department of Trade, the institutes of technology, like the universities, became part of academic research and teaching in the context of society as a whole.
",
2592," 	From the mid 1920s, the Hannover student body was becoming more and more radical, led by nationalistic ideology and culminating in the notorious “Lessing case”.",
2593,"From 1908 the Jewish Privatdozent (private lecturer) for Philosophy, Theodor Lessing, held lectures in the Department of General Sciences.",
2594,With the reform of higher education he became an associate professor without the status of a civil servant and received a lectureship for Philosophy and Natural Sciences. 	  		,
2595,"His reporting on the Haarmann trial and his article on Hindenburg, in which he warned of the possible political consequences of Hindenburg being elected Chancellor of the Reich, led to a massive boycott of his lectures from 1925 onwards by students at the Institute of Technology, who mainly subscribed to right-wing conservative and nationalistic ideology.",
2596,"Due to public pressure, the Department of Education saw itself forced to intervene.",
2597,Disciplinary measures were introduced against the students.,
2598,On 18th June 1926 Lessing stopped lecturing and was given a permanent research contract on the philosophy of history and culture in lieu.,
2599,"When the National Socialists came to power, his research contract was withdrawn.",
2600,Theodor Lessing was assassinated in exile in Marienbad by Nazis on 31st August 1933.,
2601,"In the student council elections at Hannover Institute of Technology in 1929/1930, with a turnout of 75%, the Korporation, or Fraternity, List received a majority of 88.9%.",
2602,"The Science List, representing students who were not members of a fraternity, received 5.4%.",
2603,The National Socialist Students List received 5.8%.,
2604,In 1930 the National Socialist Students received 11.8%.,
2605,"In winter semester 1932/1933 70 students at Hannover Institute of Technology were members of the Nazi Students Association, which corresponds to 3.7% of all students After the National Socialists came to power, almost half of the students joined the Nazi Students Association by July 1933.
",
2606," 	When the First World War broke out, 910 out of 998 students at Hannover Institute of Technology signed up for military service in the first year of the war.",
2607,Almost a quarter of these were to die in the course of the war.,
2608,"Since several generations of young people were not able to study during this time, soldiers returning from the war crowded into the Institute of Technology after the war was over.",
2609,"Student numbers rose dramatically and peaked in 1921 at 3,000 students.",
2610,"After 1925, student numbers decreased steadily, reaching 1,500 in 1930.   		",
2611,"To ease the economic hardship that many students found themselves in after the war, the Hannoversche Hochschulgemeinschaft, Vereinigung von Freunden der Technischen Hochschule e. V. (Friends of Hannover Institute of Technology) was founded in 1921.",
2612,"One year later the Studentenhilfe, today’s Student Services, opened a refectory.",
2613,"After the First World War, the status of the institutes of technology in state and society and their relationship to universities became one of the central issues of higher education reform in the Weimar Republic.",
2614,The division of higher education into universities and institutes of technology that had been drawn up in the 19th century was seen as a mistake.,
2615,"The aim of the reform of higher education was to unite the different universities and institutes into one joint institute of higher education, a new universitas.",
2616,Here students of the different disciplines were to work alongside and with each other.,
2617,The sciences and the arts were to complement and stimulate each other.,
2618,A step in this direction was to introduce the same organisational structures to the institutes of technology and the universities.,
2619,For the institutes of technology this meant dissolving the departments that had existed so far and setting up faculties.,
2620,The following three faculties were introduced on 1st July 1922 at Hannover Institute of Technology:,
2621,"1.	Faculty of General Sciences (including Chemistry)<br/>2.	Faculty of Construction (Architecture and Construction)<br/>3.	Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (Mechanical Engineering, including Electrical Engineering)",
2622,"In view of its key role in the reform of the institutes of technology, the Faculty of General Sciences had moved to first place.",
2623,"Further development of General Sciences was not, however, pursued.",
2624,Professorships were not set up here and lectures were held by Privatdozente (private lecturers).,
2625,"The aim of the Weimar Reform of Higher Education to create a new universal educational institution including the institutes of technology was not realised until after the end of the Weimar Republic.
",
2626, 	The transfer of responsibility for the institutes of technology from the Department of Trade to the Department of Education paved the way for transition from a specialised institute to a broader scientific institution.,
2627,"Institutes of technology did not yet possess such crucial attributes as the right to confer doctorates, which would put them on an equal footing with the universities. 	  		",
2628,The 1880s and 1890s were marked by a rapid expansion of technology and industry.,
2629,The institutes of technology were faced with the problem of modifying their curriculum in order to keep pace with fast-changing technical developments in industry.,
2630,"The result was an expansion, differentiation and specialisation of subject matter and teaching methods.",
2631,"The training of engineers had to be adapted to the practical needs of industry, while a more theoretical and scientific approach was required to do justice to the increasingly academic nature of the institutes of technology.",
2632,"For the students, increasing specialisation and differentiation of the curriculum meant that they had up to 50 compulsory class hours per week. 	  	",
2633,The institutes of technology were faced with the task of using specific experimental methods as a basis for developing a scientific profile that would be comparable to that of the universities.,
2634,"At Hannover Institute of Technology, laboratories were set up as an important step towards systematic technical and scientific experiment-based teaching: from 1884 the mechanical engineer Hermann Fischer set up a Technological Laboratory for the Investigation of Fibrous Materials, and the electrical engineer Wilhelm Kohlrausch began to set up an electronics laboratory.",
2635,"In 1896, Franz Frese’s Machine-Engineering Laboratory was built, and further laboratories were to follow. 	  		",
2636,By the end of the 19th century the institutes of technology had created their own profile in the scientific world and had found general recognition.,
2637,"On the occasion of the centenary of Berlin Institute of Technology, Kaiser Wilhelm II granted the Prussian institutes of technology the right to confer the academic degrees of Doktor-Ingenieur and Diplom-Ingenieur.",
2638,This was the final step towards acquiring equal status with the universities.,
2639,"On 18th August 1908 the Prussian Department of Education opened up first the universities and on 14th April 1909 also the state’s institutes of technology – Berlin, Danzig, Aachen and Hannover – to women as fully matriculated students, not without drawing attention in an additional remark that “on registration for the Diplom examination they are to have fulfilled the requirements of the examination regulations in their entirety.”
",
2640, 	In 1866 Prussia annexed the Kingdom of Hannover.,
2641,It became a Prussian province.,
2642,Prussian legislation led to substantial liberalisation.,
2643,"After the foundation of the Empire in 1871, economic development was stimulated further, and many new industrial plants were created.",
2644,The downside of advancing industrialisation was an increase in social problems.,
2645,"With the incorporation of Hannover into the Prussian state, the Polytechnic was put under the responsibility of the Prussian Ministry for Trade, Industry and Public Works.",
2646,"The social status of the building officers for the State Technical Service in Hannover had to be brought up to the higher Prussian level, so as not to degrade the new Prussian province.",
2647,In 1869 Hannover Polytechnic was granted the right to offer the corresponding higher level courses and to conduct the state exams for Regierungsbauführer and Regierungsbaumeister (government foreman and government architect).,
2648,"Although the transition to a Polytechnic had been relatively rapid, the further development of the college between 1854 and Karl Karmarsch’s retirement in 1875 was rather slow.",
2649,The general trend at technical colleges towards placing engineering on a more scientific footing was not pursued under the aegis of Karmarsch.  		,
2650,"Towards the end of Karmarsch’s incumbency, a growing disparity could not be overlooked between Hannover and most other similar German technical institutions, where an understanding of the term scientific as seen by the universities was becoming increasingly accepted.",
2651,"Apart from educating officers for the State Technical Service, the college in Hannover provided practically relevant training for engineers who could quickly apply their skills in trade and industry.",
2652,"The greatest discrepancy between Hannover and the more advanced institutions lay in the college’s constitution, which had hardly been altered since its foundation.",
2653,"There was no division into departments, and the teaching staff played no part in the management or administration of the college.",
2654,The director was not elected; the school was headed by a “permanent director”.,
2655,Karl Karmarsch’s 44 year incumbency ended in 1875.,
2656,"Under his successor, the civil engineer and economist Wilhelm Launhardt, began the accelerated development of the college into an Institute of Technology.
",
2657," 	When the 1848 Revolution reached Hannover, the polytechnic students stood as one united corps in the Citizens’ Militia.",
2658,"One of them was the sixteen-year-old Wilhelm Busch, who wanted to become a mechanical engineer.",
2659,"On the whole, however, political events in Hannover passed peacefully.",
2660,A one-year preparatory school had been introduced at the polytechnic in 1847. 	 ,
2661,"On average, studies took 2 ½ years, and in 1853 the age of the students entering the college was just under 20.",
2662,The number of subjects taught tripled between 1845 and 1853.,
2663,The library built up by Karl Karmarsch could soon measure up to other similar institutions.,
2664,The chemistry laboratory set up by Friedrich Heeren in 1854/55 was regarded as one of the largest and most modern in the whole of Germany.,
2665,"The 25th anniversary of the college was a proud demonstration of what had been achieved so far, and Karl Karmarsch’s speech was full of the unwavering faith in progress of his age.  ",
2666,Hannover was growing rapidly at that time.,
2667,"The railway station in Steintorfeld was completed, and Ernst-August-Stadt between Georgstraße and the railway was incorporated.",
2668,Hannover’s industrial development was mainly in the adjoining town of Linden.,
2669,"Until Hannover joined the Zollverein in 1851, however, inner-German trade barriers prevented rapid economic growth.

2866,Anahita Khodadad Kashi and Prof. Dr. Michael Kues from the Institute of Photonics and the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD at Leibniz University Hannover (Germany) have demonstrated a novel interference effect.,
2867,"The scientists have thus shown that new colour-coded photonic networks can be tapped, and the number of photons involved, i.e. light particles, can be scaled.",

2872,"', 'The researchers have now realised a frequency beamsplitter using telecommunications components and demonstrate the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect for the first time between two independently generated photons in the frequency domain.",

2874,"Our approach allows flexible configurability and access to high-dimensional systems, which may lead to large-scale controllable quantum systems in the future, says Kues.",
2875,"This two-photon interference phenomenon can serve as a foundation for a quantum internet, non-classical communication and quantum computers.",

3185,"With around 90 billion nucleotides – the basic building blocks of the genome – the mistletoe genome is approximately 30 times larger than the human genome.', In order to analyse the mistletoe genome, scientists around Lucie Schröder, Dr. Hans-Peter Braun and Dr. Helge Küster from the Institute of Plant Genetics at LUH used a trick: The genome, which consists of DNA, was not analysed directly.",
3186,"Instead, transcripts of the genome (RNAs), which code for the mistletoe''s proteins, were isolated and transcribed into DNA using enzymes.",
3187,"The resulting shorter DNA molecules could then be subjected to systematic sequence analysis., 'This way, the researchers were able to determine more than 39,000 mistletoe gene sequences and predict corresponding protein sequences.",
3188,"For the first time, they succeeded in making a systematic inventory of which proteins and thus enzymes occur in mistletoe and which metabolic pathways this plant can perform.",
3189,"Among them are numerous known enzymes that are generally important for life processes in plants, but also special mistletoe proteins, such as viscotoxins and viscolectins, which are considered to possess significant medicinal potential.",
3190,"Furthermore, the researchers were able to demonstrate that the DNA of the protein-coding sections of the mistletoe genome is characterised by a particularly high stability compared to the DNA of other flowering plants.",
3191,"This could contribute to the stress resistance properties of mistletoe.', '“We can learn a lot from studying parasites and semi-parasites since they do not have to carry out all life processes themselves, explains Dr. Hans-Peter Braun.",

3271,"In a study published today in Nature, a team led by scientists from Cardiff University's Gravity Exploration Institute used data from the German-UK GEO600 gravitational-wave detector near Hannover, Germany, to search for a new kind of dark matter for the very first time.",
3272,"Though no direct detection has been made, this unique search is the first step in establishing a novel search method.",
3273,"The non-detection allowed the researchers to rule out some theories about dark matter and helps to improve future searches for this invisible constituent of our Universe., 'Thought to make up roughly 85% of all matter in the Universe, dark matter has never been observed directly and remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in modern physics.",
3274,"Even though dark matter has never been directly detected, scientists suspect it exists due to its gravitational effect on objects across the Universe.",
3275,"For example, a large amount of unseen matter may explain why galaxies rotate as they do, and how they could have formed in the first place.', 'Until recently, it was widely believed that dark matter was composed of heavy elementary particles.",
3276,"These were not discovered despite a multitude of efforts, and scientists are now turning to alternative theories to explain dark matter.",
3277,"A recent theory says that dark matter is actually something called a scalar field, which would behave as invisible waves bouncing around galaxies, including our own Milky Way.', 'With extremely sensitive detectors now at their disposal, already proven through several outstanding discoveries, scientists believe that existing gravitational wave technology has the true potential to finally directly discover dark matter and even find out what it is made of.', 'We realised our instruments could be used to hunt for this new kind of dark matter, although they were initially designed for detecting gravitational waves,\'\' said Hartmut Grote, from Cardiff University\'s Gravity Exploration Institute, who instigated the investigation and who was the GEO600 lead scientist from 2009 to 2017.', 'Within a laser interferometer such as GEO600, a laser is split into two beams of light that travel hundreds of meters through vacuum tubes, and are bounced between mirrors before meeting up on a detector.",
3278,"From this, scientists can gauge with great accuracy how out of sync the beams of light are with each other, which is itself proxy for any disturbance the beams encounter.",

3280,"', 'The GEO 600 detector in Germany is a highly sensitive interferometer and was used to develop much of the technology needed to detect gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo.",
3281,"Although the other detectors are more sensitive to gravitational waves, GEO600 is the most sensitive to the effects of scalar field dark matter.",
3282,"', 'Scalar field dark matter waves would pass right through the Earth and our instruments, but as they do so, would cause objects such as mirrors to vibrate ever so slightly,\'\' said lead investigator Sander Vermeulen, also from Cardiff University.",
3283,"Vibrations of mirrors would disturb the beams of light in instruments like GEO600 or the LIGO detectors in a particular way characteristic of dark matter, which is something we should be able to detect, depending on the exact properties of that dark matter.', 'Though the team were unsuccessful in making any sort of detection in this new study, they say they are making important first strides in terms of introducing this technology to dark matter searches and have already made progress in terms of narrowing down certain parameters for future studies.",
3284,"', 'I was surprised by how sensitive an instrument can be for hunting dark matter when it was built for an entirely different purpose originally, says Grote.",

3299,"Generally, conventional simulation models are identical for all turbines within a wind farm and focus on their load-bearing capacity.",
3300,"In contrast, additional aspects such as production, installation, operation or recycling are usually not paramount.', 'By means of the digital twin, the researchers of the collaborative research centre will develop a method that incorporates all of these details.",

3379,This requires a tape measure whose unit of measurement is smaller than the butterfly.,
3380,"Such differences in size can be found also in the smallest particles: For example, the size of atoms is measured with the unit of Ångström.",
3381,One Ångström corresponds to the ten-millionth part of a millimeter (10-10 meters).,
3382,"If atoms are now measured with the aid of light, the wavelength of the light serves as the unit of measurement, the division of the ruler.",

",
3481,"', 'For the first time, physicists have succeeded in successfully realizing a new method for cooling protons using laser-cooled ions - in this case beryllium ions.",
3482,The innovative feature of the new system is that the two particle types are located in spatially separated traps.,
3483,This means it is now possible to provide the cooling effect with the help of an electrical resonant circuit over a distance of nine centimetres from one trap to the other.,
3484,"The team at the PRISMA+ Cluster of Excellence at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), part of the BASE collaboration, was able to demonstrate that protons can be cooled to significantly lower temperatures in one of the traps than would be possible without beryllium.",
3485,"The new technique can be used for all charged particles, even antiprotons, for which there is no other cooling method in this temperature range.",
3486,What is particularly exciting is that it should now be possible to conduct experiments in which matter and antimatter can be compared more precisely.,
3487,The results of the research have been published in the eminent scientific journal Nature.,
3488,"In addition to JGU, the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg (MPIK) and the Japanese Research Center RIKEN were also significantly involved in the new development, as were the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN, the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt and Leibniz University Hannover.', '', 'In order to be able to make precise measurements of individual ions, they must be captured and stored in a trap in which they are kept as inert as possible.",
3489,"To achieve this state, energy is removed from the charged particles, which reduces their temperature.",
3490,"With the new two-trap structure, the research team was able to reduce the temperature by about a factor of 10 in comparison with that reached using the previous best methods of cooling protons, thus attaining a temperature close to absolute zero.",
3491,"“The lower the temperature of the particle, the more precisely we can restrict the space in which the particle is present inside the trap.",
3492,"And the more accurately we can locate the particle, the better are the starting conditions and consequently also the results of our precision measurements,” explains Dr. Christian Smorra, physicist at the PRISMA+ Cluster of Excellence and co-author of the publication.', '', '', 'The new two-trap cooling method comes with even more advantages: It can also be used for antimatter particles because in a single-trap cooling system, the matter and antimatter would immediately destroy each other.",
3493,The new concept will enable more precise comparison of protons and antiprotons.,
3494,“We want to look specifically for any difference between the properties of protons and antiprotons.,
3495,"Our theory says that the two particles behave identically, the only distinction being the opposed charges.",
3496,"It is still unclear why our universe contains so many protons – and therefore matter – but almost no antiprotons, that is antimatter,” points out Matthew Bohman of MPIK, the first author of the study.",
3497,"Bohman has been working on the development of the new cooling method in Mainz since 2018, when he was studying for his doctorate.', 'Whereas previous methods required distances of 0.1 millimetres or less between the particles to be cooled and the beryllium ions, the current research has shown it is in fact possible to transmit the cooling effect despite spatial separation over a distance of nine centimetres.",
3498,"This creates the basis for further research projects – and enables, for example, uninterrupted and more precise frequency measurements, which the BASE collaboration plans to carry out in the case of antimatter in the context of the search for dark matter.",
3499,"The research group had already investigated trapped antiprotons in a single trap during previous experiments at CERN – however, this was done by cooling them with liquid helium and without employing beryllium ions.', '', '', 'The two-trap method was proposed for the first time in 1990.",
3500,"The concept at the time did not include an electric resonant circuit – instead, the ions were to be connected by a common trap electrode.",
3501,"The advantage of this procedure was that no resistance was present, such as that caused by the resonant circuit, which produces heat and impairs the cooling process.",
3502,"The big disadvantage, however, is the low speed at which the energy of the ions is exchanged.",
3503,"As a result, the temperature of the charged particle does not decrease quickly enough.",
3504,“The current system represents a practically feasible development of the concept dating back to 1990.,
3505,"In this case, the energy exchange between the traps occurs within one second rather than taking getting on for two minutes,” stresses Dr. Christian Smorra.', '', 'In the future, it will be possible to cool the motion of the particles even further and down to absolute zero, where all motion is frozen out.",
3506,Then it will be possible to completely control the particles in all degrees of freedom.,

I am delighted that Professor Trabattoni\'s junior professorship within the scope of the first joint appointment will enable us to work more closely with Leibniz University Hannover, says Edgar Weckert, head of photon research at DESY.",
3512,"This will bring together our joint expertise in this exciting field of research focusing on ultra-fast laser spectroscopy.', 'The long-term objective of their research activities is to use lasers to control and manipulate electrons in processes connected with atomic nuclei.",
3513,Atomic nuclei consist of protons and neutrons surrounded by a kind of electron cloud.,
3514,"Together, these two groups form atoms.",
3515,Electrons are usually located outside of the nucleus.,
3516,"However, there are plenty of natural processes where electrons and nuclei interact and exchange energy.",
3517,"For example, these processes are particularly important in order to track solar activity or in order to produce medical isotopes.",
3518,"We are familiar with these processes, even though we cannot control them, explains Professor Trabattoni.",
3519,"For some nuclear reactions, we would have to wait a thousand years, or even longer.",
3520,"If we find the right controller, we might be able to steer them within the fraction of a second.', 'This controller is achieved through customised laser light able to mediate the interaction between nuclei and electrons.",
3521,"Currently, Professor Trabattoni and his team investigate this concept in special low-energy electron-nucleus transitions, which can be triggered with conventional lasers.",

3527,"Recently, funding for projects focusing on sustainability, climate protection and renewable energies has been increased significantly, both in Lower Saxony and throughout Germany.', 'In order to replicate offshore conditions, scientists filled the ten-metre deep geotechnical test pit at the Test Centre for Support Structures (TTH) of LUH under defined conditions with sand that has typical offshore properties in terms of structure and grain size.",
3528,The water level was then raised to the upper edge of the sand.,

3717,"The data-set was accumulated over 1.5 years of measurement time, allowing for the first differential antiproton/proton test of the Einstein weak equivalence principle, which says that matter and antimatter behave the same under gravity.', 'Symmetry and beauty are closely related, not only in music, arts and architecture, but also in the fundamental laws of physics that describe our universe.",
3718,"It is in some sense ironic that our existence seems to be a consequence of a broken symmetry in the best fundamental theory that exists, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.",
3719,"One of the cornerstones of the SM is the charge, parity, time (CPT) reversal invariance.",

3721,"As a consequence of CPT symmetry, matter/antimatter conjugates have the same masses, charges, and magnetic moments, the latter of opposite sign.",
3722,"Another consequence of CPT is that once matter/antimatter conjugates collide, they annihilate to pure energy, as observed in many laboratory experiments.",
3723,"In that sense, the existence of our Universe is not self-evident at all.",
3724,We have reason to assume that in the Big Bang matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts.,
3725,"Why only matter remained, which makes up the celestial bodies in the universe, has yet to be understood.', 'Another hot topic in modern physics is whether matter and antimatter behave the same under gravity.",
3726,"In their new article, the BASE scientists compared the similarity of antiproton and proton mass ratios as well as antimatter and matter clocks while the earth was tracing the gravitational potential of the sun, which means, that they have simultaneously studied both questions in one measurement.', To perform their high precision studies, the team around Stefan Ulmer, chief scientist at RIKEN, Japan, and Spokesperson of the BASE collaboration, used a Penning trap, an electromagnetic container capable of storing and detecting a single quantum of charge.",
3727,A single particle in such a trap oscillates with a characteristic frequency defined by the mass of the particle.,
3728,Listening to oscillation frequencies of antiprotons and protons in the same trap allows the scientists to compare their masses.,
3729,"By loading an advanced stack of such Penning traps with antiprotons and negative hydrogen ions, Ulmer''s team established a frequency comparison scheme, which enables a single mass comparison in a measurement time of only four minutes, 50 times faster than in previous proton/antiproton comparisons by other trap groups.",
3730,"Compared to their earlier measurements, the BASE team has substantially improved the experimental apparatus with several technical upgrades that enhance experiment stability and reduce systematic shifts in their measurements.",
3731,"In this advanced instrument, the BASE team sampled a data set of about 24000 individual frequency comparisons in a time window of 1.5 years.",
3732,"Combining all the measured results they were able to compare the antiproton and proton charge-to-mass ratios with a precision of 16 parts in a trillion, a number with 11 significant digits, that improved the precision of the best previous measurement by more than a factor of 4., 'A particle oscillating in a Penning trap can be considered as a clock, an antiparticle as an anti-clock.",
3733,Clocks at high gravitational potential go slower.,
3734,During the long-term measurement of 1.5 years the earth on its elliptic orbit was tracing different gravitational potentials of the sun.,
3735,"With different gravitational behaviour of antimatter and matter, the matter and antimatter clocks would experience along earths interplanetary trajectory different frequency shifts.",
3736,"Analysing their data with respect to such beating signatures as a function of time and gravitational potential, the BASE scientists were not able to find any frequency anomaly, which enables them to set first direct and largely model independent limits on anomalous behaviour of antimatter in gravitational fields.",
3737,"', 'This interpretation of the data-set constrains the first differential limits on the weak equivalence principle for clocks, at a precision level similar to those anticipated by our colleagues which drop antihydrogen in the gravitational field of the earth, says Stefan Ulmer.",
3738,"First experimental results by those experiments will likely become available within the next few antiproton runs, if they would find something while we do not, that would lead to another exciting physics puzzle beyond the Standard Model.', 'In order to be able to measure with even greater precision, the measurements must be carried out on even colder particles.",
3739,"To this end, Leibniz University Hannover and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt are developing techniques within the framework of BASE with which the (anti-)protons can be cooled even further so that they are most likely to be at absolute zero motion.",
3740,"To achieve this, the controlled interaction with a laser-cooled ion will be used, as it is also being used, for example, within the framework of Quantum Valley Lower Saxony (QVLS) for the development of future quantum computers.",

3820,"', It is about fundamental questions of modern fundamental physics: Is our description of nature complete?",
3821,What is dark matter?,
3822,Do natural constants change with time or place?,
3823,Theoretical predictions attest optical clocks based on highly charged ions a 20-fold sensitivity to these effects compared to previous clocks.,
3824,"With a concept for the first-time realization of such special clocks, in which the highly charged ions are controlled by quantum techniques and measured by laser spectroscopy, Prof. Dr. Piet O. Schmidt (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt and Leibniz Universität Hannover) has now obtained one of the most prestigious research grants: an ERC Advanced Grant.",
3825,"With this, the European Research Council (ERC) is providing almost 2.5 million euros for a five-year project.",
3826,"Schmidt''s goal: to achieve at least a 10-fold improvement in the limits for new forces and changes in natural constants and also to address important questions in astronomy and plasma physics with his novel measurement methods., 'Schmidt has given the planned project the name FunClocks, where Fun stands for Fundamental Physics.",
3827,"The fact that the name also reminds him of fun is not unpleasant to Schmidt: It\'\'s already a great satisfaction to do research at this level, he says.",
3828,Schmidt is one of the world\'\'s leading scientists in the field of quantum logic spectroscopy.,
3829,This involves combining optical spectroscopy with quantum technology methods: Researchers take advantage of the fact that two different particles can be quantum mechanically coupled.,
3830,"They use a so-called logic ion for manipulations and control, such as extreme cooling and subsequent spectroscopic measurement, to ultimately find out about another ion.",
3831,Exactly the same methods are being used in Quantum Valley Lower Saxony (QVLS) to build a 50-qubit quantum computer.,
3832,"In our experiments, we benefit from the unique environment with PTB as a national metrology institute, the Leibniz University, the technology development within QVLS, and the basic research on new physics within the Cluster of Excellence QuantumFrontiers, Schmidt points out, who is also speaker of QuantumValley Lower Saxony.'",
3833,", In their latest experiment, Schmidt''s team used the combination of beryllium (as a logic ion) and highly charged argon (as a spectroscopy ion, i.e., the actual object of their interest).",
3834,"In doing so, the researchers, who worked closely with colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, achieved an improvement of nine orders of magnitude over previous setups in which highly charged ions were created and studied in electron beam ion traps.",
3835,"With this huge increase in accuracy, they achieved a breakthrough for the use of highly charged ions in high-precision spectroscopy, as used in optical atomic clocks., 'A highly charged ion is an atom that has lost many electrons and therefore has a high positive charge.",
3836,"The more highly charged an ion, the closer the remaining electrons are to the nucleus of the atom and the faster they move as well.",
3837,"This leads to the high sensitivity of these ions to effects postulated by the new physics, while at the same time being insensitive to external perturbation effects.",
3838,"This makes highly charged ions particularly attractive for optical clocks, says Schmidt.",
3839,Our new method allows us to study highly charged ions in a wide variety of charge states.,
3840,"This gives the periodic table a third dimension, namely the charge state, Schmidt explains.",
3841,"With this, his team plans to build optical atomic clocks with different species that can be selected according to their properties, for example, in terms of their suitability for detecting dark matter and possible changes in the fine structure constant, or in terms of being helpful in the search for previously undiscovered so-called fifth forces.",
3842,"These forces are predicted in New Physics theories such as string theory, but so far have not been detected beyond doubt even with the best available measurements.', 'While this is a field exclusively for measurements of the highest accuracy, the team in the project also aims to develop other, somewhat simpler methods of precision spectroscopy on highly charged ions, which could then find a variety of applications in astronomy or plasma physics, for example.', 'The ERC Advanced Grant is one of the most highly endowed research funding awards of all.",

3874,"For this purpose, a commercial TOF-SIMS finstrument (static secondary ion mass spectrometry) is combined with lasers in order to ionize various elements selectively.",

4269,"In practice, however, only visual diagnostics based on dermatoscopic devices placed directly on the suspicious skin areas are established so far.",
4270,"Moreover, these systems\'\' contact mode of operation can falsify diagnoses and make it challenging to detect changes of skin lesions over time, particularly when patients have dozens of them on their bodies.",
4271,"The iToBoS researchers now aim to increase diagnostic precision with the help of non-contact imaging, which captures the entire skin surface simultaneously, in combination with individual patient data.', 'The iToBoS full-body scanner will be equipped with optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) and incorporates information from all relevant sources, i.e. dermatoscopic images and patient records, into the diagnosis.",

4311,Suspicious lesions will be scanned non-invasively potentially replacing surgical excision and histopathology.,
4312,"Furthermore, waiting times for doctors and patients will be reduced, as they will know immediately after the scan whether the lesion is malignant or not.",
4313,"The new procedure could also save costs for unnecessary interventions, as currently 86 to 95 per cent of the lesions turn out to be benign.', 'The non-invasive system will also incorporate concepts from artificial intelligence so that the diagnostic accuracy can be improved continuously.",

4349,"In particular, two photons may arrive at the receiver simultaneously.",
4350,"For many applications, however, it is desirable that one photon is registered after the other, i.e. that the light particles are lined up like a string of pearls.",
4351,"Such isolated photons are, for example, a basic requirement for quantum communication, where one can communicate in a fundamentally tap-proof way.",
4352,"Until now, single quantum emitters such as a single atom or a single molecule have typically acted as sources for such streams of individual photons.",
4353,"If the quantum emitter is excited with laser light and fluoresces, it will always emit exactly one photon with each quantum leap.",

4361,This system enabled the researchers to precisely control the number of atoms along the laser beam.,
4362,"In the experiment, the researchers then analyzed how often the photons came out of the fiber individually or in pairs.",
4363,"When about 150 atoms were trapped near the nanofiber, it turned out that the transmitted light consisted practically only of isolated photons.",

4431,"', 'Optical atomic clocks are the most accurate measuring instruments ever built and are becoming key tools for basic and applied research, for example to test the constancy of natural constants or for height measurements in geodesy.",
4432,"Now, researchers at the QUEST Institute at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (MPIK), the TU Braunschweig and Leibniz University Hannover and in the scope of the QuantumFrontiers Cluster of Excellence, have realised for the first time an optical atomic clock based on highly charged ions.",
4433,This type of ion lends itself to such an application because it has extraordinary atomic properties and low sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields.,
4434,The researchers report on their results in the current issue of Nature.,
4435,"', 'Highly charged ions are a common form of matter in the cosmos, where they are found, for example, in the sun or other stars.",
4436,They are so called because they have lost many electrons and therefore have a high positive charge.,
4437,This is why the outermost electrons are more strongly bound to the atomic nucleus than in neutral or weakly charged atoms.,
4438,"For this reason, highly charged ions react less strongly to interference from external electromagnetic fields, but become more sensitive probes of fundamental effects of special relativity, quantum electrodynamics and the atomic nucleus.",
4439,"“Therefore, we expected that an optical atomic clock with highly charged ions would help us to better test these fundamental theories”, explains PTB physicist Lukas Spieß.",
4440,"This hope has already been fulfilled: “We were able to detect the quantum electrodynamic nuclear recoil, an important theoretical prediction, in a five-electron system, which has not been achieved in any other experiment before.”",
4441,"', 'Beforehand, the team had to solve some fundamental problems, such as detection and cooling, in years of work: For atomic clocks, one has to cool the particles down extremely in order to stop them as much as possible and thus read out their frequency at rest.",
4442,"Highly charged ions, however, are produced by creating an extremely hot plasma.",
4443,"Because of their extreme atomic structure, highly charged ions can’t be cooled directly with laser light, and standard detection methods can’t be used either.",
4444,This was solved by a collaboration between MPIK in Heidelberg and the QUEST Institute at PTB by isolating a single highly charged argon ion from a hot plasma and storing it in an ion trap together with a singly charged beryllium ion.,
4445,This allows the highly charged ion to be cooled indirectly and studied by means of the beryllium ion.,
4446,"An advanced cryogenic trap system was then built at MPIK and finalized at PTB for the following experiments, which were carried out in part by students switching between the institutions.",
4447,"Subsequently, a quantum algorithm developed at PTB succeeded in cooling the highly charged ion even further, namely close to the quantum mechanical ground state.",
4448,This corresponded to a temperature of 200 millionths of a kelvin above absolute zero.,
4449,These results were already published in Nature in 2020 and in Physical Review X in 2021.,
4450,"', 'Now the researchers have successfully taken the next step: They have realised an optical atomic clock based on thirteen-fold charged argon ions and compared the ticking with the existing ytterbium ion clock at PTB.",
4451,"To do this, they had to analyse the system in great detail in order to understand, for example, the movement of the highly charged ion and the effects of external interference fields.",
4452,They achieved a measurement uncertainty of 2 parts in 1017 − comparable to many currently operated optical atomic clocks.,
4453,"“We expect a further reduction of the uncertainty through technical improvements, which should bring us into the range of the best atomic clocks,” says research group leader Piet Schmidt.', 'The researchers have thus created an additional system to the existing optical atomic clocks based on, for example, individual ytterbium ions or neutral strontium atoms.",
4454,The methods used are universally applicable and allow many different highly charged ions to be studied.,
4455,These include atomic systems that can be used to search for extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.,
4456,"Other highly charged ions are particularly sensitive to changes in the fine structure constant and to certain dark matter candidates that are required in models beyond the Standard Model but could not be detected with previous methods.

4904,"We are delighted that the instrument looks and sounds very attractive, as confirmed by the feedback from the organists and the audience at the White Hall».",
4905,Twice each month the world’s and Russia’s finest organists present an anthology of organ music at the White Hall.,

",
5130,Georgy KASHIN from the Institute of Computer Science and Technology at SPbPU went to Poznan Technical University (Poland) for the fall semester.,
5131,The study took place within the Erasmus+ project.,
5132,"Read about who is suitable for studying at the Polish university, peculiarities of university classrooms and a distinctive feature of public transport in Poznan in our interview.",
5133,— I was curious to know how studying at European universities works.,
5134,"Therefore, when I learned about the possibility for students of Polytechnic University to go to study abroad, I decided to try.",
5135,"Preparing for the trip was easy, but I had to deal with the visa.",
5136,— How was the trip to the university?,
5137,Do you remember your first impressions of the new country?,
5138,"— It took me a long time to get to my new university, the flight alone took 22 hours — I had to change planes in Helsinki.",
5139,Then I took two trains from Warsaw to Poznan.,
5140,Everything was unusual and very interesting.,
5141,Probably the first thing that surprised me when I landed in Poland was that everyone spoke different languages.,
5142,"Some in Polish, some in English, and some in Russian.",
5143,— Were there any difficulties with adaptation in the new place?,
5144,— Adapting was easy enough.,
5145,"In any situation, you can use the question in English: «Could you please tell me...?»",
5146,They will try to help you if possible.,
5147,"Generally speaking, life in Poland is not very different from life in Russia.",
5148,"If you walk down the street and don’t talk to anyone, you think you’ve never gone anywhere.",
5149,"So if you are having trouble adapting to a new place, but would like to go and study abroad, Poland would be an excellent option.",
5150,— What are your impressions of the dormitory and the campus of the Technical University of Poznan in general?,
5151,"— I have only positive impressions of the dormitory, even though the cost of living there is 10 times higher than here.",
5152,"It has its kitchen, bathroom, everything is clean, neat and comfortable.",
5153,"The main university building was built not so long ago, it looks nice and modern.",
5154,"Of the things that seemed unusual — almost all the classrooms are separated from the corridors by the glass, so you can see everything that happens around.",
5155,— Was there anything that surprised you about your new university?,
5156,"— Of course, at first it was unusual.",
5157,"A new language, new people, not sure how to communicate with the teachers.",
5158,"But now everything seems normal, the learning process is not much different from ours.",
5159,"We found a common language with the lecturers and students without any problems, they were all very friendly.",
5160,There is an interesting thing that is probably very difficult for Russian students to understand: here you can not pass two labs to choose from and still get the highest grade.,
5161,"Clearly, you shouldn’t abuse this!",
5162,— How is your education during the pandemic?,
5163,"— We study at a university, online lectures are only for large groups and only where everyone speaks Polish.",
5164,The mask regime is quite strictly enforced.,
5165,— What do you think about Poznan?,
5166,— The city is very quiet and small compared to St. Petersburg.,
5167,"At first, I was not used to the fact that every day the bell tolls at noon sharp.",
5168,"Separately, I want to tell you about the public transportation system, it’s very well developed here, and all the streetcars and buses have their distinctive color — green.",
5169,— What do you see as the benefits of participating in exchange programs?,
5170,"— For myself, I identified three key benefits.",
5171,The first is an opportunity to practice English and start learning a new language (in my case — Polish).,
5172,"The second one is to see how they teach abroad, the level of education, different methods, approaches, etc.",
5173,"And, of course, it’s an opportunity to see another country, culture, new people.",
5174,— What advice would you give to students who also want to go to study abroad?,
5175,— The most important thing is to understand why you need it.,
5176,"Without a doubt, do not take part in an exchange program just because of the scholarship.",
5177,"However, if you have a goal to enter, for example, a master’s degree program at a foreign university, such a program is a great opportunity to find out what awaits you in a longer study, and help prepare for it.
",
5178,We continue to report on how SPbPU students study abroad during the pandemics.,
5179,"This winter, Valeria OKROMELIDZE, a student of the Graduate School of Cyberphysical Systems and Control at IKNT SPbPU, went to study at the University of Turku (Finland) as part of the First+ program.",
5180,You can read about how the training within the framework of the European project goes in the relevant section on Polytechnic University’s website or in our interview.,
5181,"- Valeria, good to see you!",
5182,Was it difficult to prepare for the trip?,
5183,- It took quite some time to prepare for the trip.,
5184,"I had to make a visa, collect the necessary documents and signatures, book a place in the dormitory of the Finnish university.",
5185,- How long will you study in Finland?,
5186,- I arrived in Helsinki at the beginning of January and from there I went to the city of Turku where my university is located.,
5187,There I will study until the end of May. -,
5188,Do you remember your first impressions upon arrival?,
5189,Was it easy to get used to living in a new city?,
5190,-,
5191,"My impressions were the best, and they remain the same.",
5192,I got used to everything quite easily.,
5193,"I was especially pleased that everyone speaks English, so I have no problem communicating here.",
5194,"In my opinion, Finns are open and friendly, always ready to help.",
5195,- How do you find accommodation?,
5196,-,
5197,"The campus here is great, everything you need is just a stone’s throw away from the dormitory.",
5198,"One to three people are living in apartments, each of them has their own room.",
5199,- Tell me a little bit about the campus.,
5200,What’s it like?,
5201,"- I would not say that the external architecture of the university buildings is impressive, but everything inside is very well organized and modern.",
5202,"Almost all of the buildings are as close as possible to each other, it takes no more than 10 minutes to go from one to the other, but I don’t need to, because all classes are held in one building.",
5203,-,
5204,Are you currently studying remotely or on-site?,
5205,- We study in a mixed format.,
5206,The lectures take place remotely on the Zoom platform.,
5207,"If we have to do practical assignments and use laboratory equipment, we do it face-to-face.",
5208,- Is it easy to study at the new university?,
5209,"- It’s hard to study, but you gradually get used to it and get involved in the process.",
5210,The main thing is not to miss practical classes because the tasks here are very extensive and not to be afraid to ask teachers or other students questions if you don’t understand something.,
5211,- Were there any difficulties in communicating with other students and teachers?,
5212,- I had no trouble finding a common language with students and professors.,
5213,"Teachers are always open to communication, they ask questions and are willing to offer advice or explain things in more detail.",
5214,"- And in general, what’s the situation in the city now?",
5215,Have you already had time to see the local sights?,
5216,"- At the moment the restrictions are gradually going down, most public places are open, the university, as I said, has full-time classes.",
5217,"Speaking of interesting places in Turku, I managed to see Abobo Castle and the Cathedral.",
5218,"I want to visit the coast, but it is almost completely occupied by the port, and it is not easy to get there.",
5219,"In the future I plan to visit other Finnish cities and, if possible, neighboring countries.",
5220,"- In your opinion, what are the key benefits of exchange student internships?",
5221,"- I would say the advantages are increased responsibility and autonomy, the development of a quick orientation in unexpected situations, the experience of another educational system, excellent language practice, the opportunity to travel, and, of course, new acquaintances.",
5222,"- What advice would you give to students who, when the pandemic ends and the borders open, want to go to study abroad?",
5223,-,
5224,"First, be responsible regarding your paperwork and your studies, as this is the main purpose of the trip.",
5225,"Secondly, I would recommend arriving before classes start so that you can resolve all domestic, financial, and organizational issues as quickly as possible, as well as get used to the new environment and explore the city a bit.",
5226,"- Valeria, thank you for the interesting interview!",
5227,"We wish you success in your studies and new achievements!
",
5228,"Professor Herbert Huppert is not only an outstanding scientist, but also a person with a sparkling sense of humor.",
5229,"“After my lectures, in an amazing way, it’s messy on the lecturing desk and orderly in the audience’s heads,” he says.",
5230,It is not surprising that Professor Huppert’s lectures are always to a full house.,
5231,"He shares his knowledge with students all over the world, giving lectures on fluid mechanics, granular flows and geophysics, which are accompanied by experiments and case studies.",
5232,"Recently Professor Huppert has visited Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (Russia), and had a talk with its representatives.",
5233,We talked with Professor Huppert and asked: what qualities must you have in order to become a successful scientist; what distinguishes a person of science from a politician:and why a professor should insist on giving students the opportunity to take exams at any time of the day by their choice.,
5234,"- Professor Huppert, it is very pleasant that now you are a good friend of Polytechnic University!",
5235,Would you tell us how you got acquainted with it?,
5236,"- I came to Russia last summer to attend a conference on Advanced Problems in Mechanics, which was taking place at your university.",
5237,"After the event, its organizers (Higher School of Theoretical Mechanics – Ed. Note) invited me to come again to tell students about the principles of convection, gravitational flows, the propagation of cracks in solids, and climate change.",
5238,"And now, together with your university scientist Vitaly Kuzkin, we are working on a scientific article.",
5239,- What will this article be about?,
5240,"- About 30 years ago, I conducted an experiment with honey.",
5241,Its fluidity corresponds to the behavior of volcanic lava moving on the ground.,
5242,The results of my experiment have wide scientific and industrial applications and became quite famous.,
5243,"But I wondered what would happen if the surface along which the lava flows is not flat, but has impediments?",
5244,"For example, some elevations on the surface of the earth can be high enough for lava not to overcome them.",
5245,"With Vitaly, we are computing such situations in order to understand what changes would occur in the movement of lava and what impact these irregularities on its path might have.",
5246,- We’ll be looking forward to the release of the article!,
5247,"By the way, have you considered this issue with students at your seminars?",
5248,-,
5249,"Yes, I did touch on this topic.",
5250,The workshops were dedicated to solving problems in fluid processes.,
5251,"I spoke about different aspects of liquid media which play a huge role in the atmosphere, the oceans, and affect the movement of magma and lava.",
5252,"Talking about this, I not only expressed my point of view to the students, but also tried to understand their view on these processes; I asked them to share their ideas.",
5253,I hope it was no less useful to them then it was for me.,
5254,- I think that the fact that you had full auditoriums at each of your seminars proves this quite well.,
5255,And how often do you hold such meetings with students?,
5256,-,
5257,"Last year, I lectured in Australia.",
5258,"I told them that the Earth can become too hot a planet for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and why politicians and scientists are different.",
5259,- And why?,
5260,-,
5261,"Well, let’s consider a problem.",
5262,A politician would say: “I want to know the answer now!” and would come up with some solution.,
5263,A scientist would say: “What an interesting matter!,
5264,"If you give me 10 million pounds and support three students, then I will give you an answer in 5 years.”",
5265,But you can be sure that the answer will be correct and accurate.,
5266,"For politicians, science and accuracy are not so important, especially if an answer is urgently needed.",
5267,"And for scientists, it’s important to find exact scientific answers, and no matter how long it takes.",
5268,- And is the younger generation interested in finding exact answers?,
5269,- I see that many young people are interested in science.,
5270,They scrutinize climate change and wonder why it is sunny today and cloudy tomorrow; why it gets hotter every year; what it signals; and why earthquakes happen.,
5271,"They want to understand how things work, how we live and how we age.",
5272,And they crave for answers to these questions.,
5273,They are always interested when I show them experiments applying to real life.,
5274,- What qualities will enable them to become successful scientists?,
5275,- Broad outlook and good imagination.,
5276,I’ll give you an example.,
5277,"At each seminar, I show students a real problem that I am going to solve.",
5278,"And once, one of your students said to me politely: “What you have just showed is enough.",
5279,I can give you the answer.”,
5280,"And I replied to her that this could not be possible; it was only an assumption for solving the problem, because the problem could be looked at differently.",
5281,"After all, what I showed was only an experiment with honey spilled on the table, a sample.",
5282,And things can change.,
5283,"It is very important to have imagination in order to be able to see everything differently, from the other side.",
5284,"In my opinion, this is the most important thing in the work of a scientist.",
5285,-,
5286,Which scientific area is the most popular in our time in your opinion?,
5287,"- I think, it’s biology.",
5288,"Everyone more or less understands physics, but with regard to biology, there are so many questions with no answers so far: why do our brains look the same, but each one works in completely different ways; why some people speak 20 languages, and some find it difficult to manage just one.",
5289,"Yes, we understand that these are features of the brain, but still ...",
5290,how does it work?,
5291,"- And what, in your opinion, is the most important scientific achievement of the 21st century??",
5292,- It’s hard to answer.,
5293,"Perhaps, it’s the development of high-energy processes.",
5294,One of my favorite examples is the story of Robert Fitzroy.,
5295,"He commanded the Beagle expedition, in which Charles Darwin took part.",
5296,He was appointed as the second Governor General of New Zealand in 1842.,
5297,"In order to reach New Zealand from London, he, his family and the crew had to live through 9 months of exhausting journey.",
5298,"And now, after 100 years, we can travel the same distance in less than 24 hours.",
5299,Imagine Fitzroy’s reaction!,
5300,“What?!,
5301,I spent 9 months on that damn ship;and you can do it in about a day?,
5302,"I do not believe that!So, technology is developing, and that is our greatest achievement.",
5303,"Another significant scientific achievement, in my opinion, is mobile phones and general technical advances.",
5304,"- Professor Huppert, lets get a little personal.",
5305,"What is your favorite book?, - I like various books; its hard to choose one.",
5306,"Let me tell you about the book Sleep, which I read just recently.",
5307,It was written by Nick Littlehales.,
5308,It is about a football adviser who was interested in the science of sleep and advised many football teams.,
5309,"Imagine: the match is coming to an end, having been delayed by rain, and then extra time, leading to a penalty shoot out.",
5310,"The score is 5:4, and the coach needs to choose a player who can take the crucial penalty.",
5311,"Among the equal strengths of players A and B, he decides in favor of player A.",
5312,"The guy misses, the team loses.",
5313,The author explained the trainers mistake: people are composed of “larks” and “owls”.,
5314,"The former feel great in the morning, but by the evening they are already tired.",
5315,"The latter get up later, but remain awake until late at night.",
5316,Player A was a “lark”.,
5317,He was already exhausted by the end of the match.,
5318,"Player B was an “owl”, and for the crucial penalty it was necessary to choose him.,",
5319,- Why this exactly book was so interesting for you?,
5320,-,
5321,The author cites excellent examples.,
5322,"I read the book and thought: after all, exams in the early morning are an advantage for the “larks” and an ordeal for the “owls”.",
5323,The “larks” would easily pass the morning exam with excellent marks.,
5324,"For the “owls,” it can seem terribly complicated.",
5325,So why can’t it be that students take exams at a time convenient for them?,
5326,I am sure that the university administration would say that this is stupid and ridiculous – to let students take exams at the time they prefer.,
5327,"But if I find a person who can conduct good scientific research, write a scientific paper and prove this theory, I would allow my students to take exams at a time convenient for them.",
5328,And allow graduate students to work at their “best” times.,
5329,"- Professor Huppert, thank you very much for the interview!",
5330,"We are waiting for you again at Polytechnic University with lectures, seminars and new interesting stories!",
5331,- I have already accepted the invitation to the next conference on “Advanced Problems in Mechanics”.,
5332,Thus next summer I will definitely return to Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.,
5333,For reference: Professor Herbert Huppert is an outstanding scientist.,
5334,"He teaches at the University of Cambridge and Bristol, the University of New South Wales (Australia); he is a member of the Royal Society, the American Geophysical Union and the American Physical Society.",
5335,"The professor has written over 280 scientific papers on applied mathematics, fluid mechanics, geophysics, meteorology, oceanography, geology and the natural sciences in general and has a Hirsch index of 78 (according to Google Scholar).
",
5336,"Many Chinese students at SPbPU this year received degrees in their chosen fields, but they do not plan to stop there: some intend to continue their education in Master’s degree programs, and some in postgraduate programs.",
5337,Recently we talked to SPbPU graduates from China.,
5338,"Yang Shujie, Gong Bowen, and NanXiang Wang shared their impressions about studying at Polytechnic University and their plans for the future, and, of course, wished good luck to future students.  ",
5339,"“Polytechnic University is a well-known university, especially when it comes to engineering specialties.",
5340,This was very important for me when choosing a place to study.,
5341,"I studied at the Institute of Machinery, Materials, and Transport and studied material science and technology.",
5342,I have a very good impression of the teachers - they not only provide educational material but also act as mentors and friends and help me deal with difficult situations.,
5343,"In the first months of life in Russia, of course, it is difficult for an international student.",
5344,The habits and way of life here are very different from China.,
5345,"But gradually I got used to it, and now it’s easy for me here.",
5346,"I love walking along the embankments of St. Petersburg, it’s a very beautiful city.",
5347,"My wish for all future students is to be active in class, not to be afraid of teachers, study hard and finish what you start,’ said Yang Shujie, an SPbPU graduate from China.",
5348,"“I studied at the Institute of Energy, studying power engineering.",
5349,"I have been interested in engineering since childhood, I liked Lego constructors and assembling something with my own hands, that’s why I had no doubts when choosing my future profession.",
5350,"When I came to Polytechnic University and began to live in Russia, at first it was not easy.",
5351,"I did not know the language, I lived in a foreign country, everything was new.",
5352,"Now, seven years later, I can say that Russia has become my second homeland.",
5353,"I’ve been to a lot of places, I’ve got my favorite places here, for example, I like to go to the Gulf of Finland and admire the sea.",
5354,Recently I defended my Master’s degree thesis and received a diploma with honors.,
5355,"Shortly, I plan to continue in postgraduate school.",
5356,I think that Polytechnic University is the best technical university in Russia.,
5357,"Its worth studying here,” said Gong Bowen, a graduate of SPbPU from China.,  “Before I came to Russia, I studied Russian at school for six months.",
5358,I liked it very much.,
5359,After talking to my parents and getting their approval I decided to come here.,
5360,"It wasn’t easy at first, life in Russia was very different from life in China.",
5361,"Then I met some friends, we started walking around the city, and, in general, I gradually got the hang of it.",
5362,"In the beginning, a lot of things in Russia surprised me.",
5363,"China is a country with a lot of people, we have lots of tall buildings.",
5364,"And in St. Petersburg, old architecture, which I haven’t seen in China, is in abundance.",
5365,"My favorite place in St. Petersburg is the 300th Anniversary Park, with its beautiful view of the gulf.  ",
5366,"I studied at SPbPU at the Institute of Industrial Management, Economics and Trade.",
5367,The language of instruction was English.,
5368,"The teachers at Polytechnic University are very polite and kind, but at the same time, they are quite strict.",
5369,I think that is good for the students.,
5370,Now I have finished my bachelor’s degree program and I am planning to go to graduate school.,
5371,"I advise everyone to come to Polytechnic University: it is a very good university,” said SPbPU graduate from China NanXiang Wang.
",
5372,"A Cross-Cultural School on Entrepreneurship and Marketing, held as part of the International Polytechnic Summer School, caused a real WOW effect among foreign participants.",
5373,"This year, more than 90 students from Shanghai Maritime University (PRC) joined it, which was one of the record numbers of the season.",
5374,It is important to note that such an impressive enrollment in the program was possible due to the joint work of the SPbPU International Office and SPbPU Representative Office in Shanghai.  ,
5375,“The cross-cultural school on entrepreneurship and marketing immediately attracted the interest of SPbPUs Shanghai partners.,
5376,As a result - more than 90 participants from China.,
5377,"Naturally, we immediately tried to adapt this educational product to the Chinese audience.",
5378,"I would like to thank everyone at once for these two weeks - students of Shanghai Maritime University, teachers of Polytechnic University, guest speakers from Russia, France, and Great Britain, as well as colleagues from SPbPU International Office and Shanghai, who made this summer school possible and provided full organizational and technical support,”\rsaid the program coordinator of the Graduate School of Technology Entrepreneurship (GSTE) SPbPU Vladimir SHCHEGOLEV.",
5379,", The idea for the Cross-Cultural School of Entrepreneurship and Marketing was born relatively recently when technological entrepreneurship in B2C markets (from Business-To-Consumer) became one of the important goals of the National Technology Initiative.",
5380,"During the two-week intensive, the school participants learned how to identify the target audience in the Russian B2C market - FoodNet was chosen for this purpose in 2021.",
5381,"In addition, students studied the behavior of potential consumers, developed value and product on the basis of a full research project, worked on the definition of a business model, etc.",
5382,"During the program, there were regular guest seminars by leading experts in the field of international marketing and electronic commerce from Russia, France, Great Britain, and other countries.",
5383,"Thus, lectures for participants were given by the Senior Digital and E-commerce Manager of Paul UK (international network of bakeries)",
5384,Anya MACKESSY (Great Britain) and Professor of IDRAQ Business School Jessica LICHY (France).,
5385,"With the support of GSTE, SPbPU foreign colleagues held intensive seminars on modern aspects of e-commerce in B2C markets in a pandemic and modern business models of the FoodNet market with digital approaches to working with consumers.",
5386,"Active work within the framework of the school was also conducted by SPbPU lecturers – Associate Professors Vladimir SHCHEGOLEV and Oksana EVSEEVA presented to students the specifics of developing a business model, value and product for the international market, while Assistant Professor Alexei TRYKOV gave lectures on marketing.",
5387,The presentations and projects of the school participants received high marks from the school faculty and invited experts.,
5388,"It is important to note that five international schools in English have already been held this year in close cooperation between GSTE IAMT, SPbPU, and Polytechnic University International Office.",
5389,"Their key focus is on international technological entrepreneurship, business development, and innovative supply chain management, as well as cross-cultural marketing in the context of digitalization.",
5390,"“We closely follow current trends and quickly incorporate them into the educational process, and we are in close contact with both foreign market leaders and the outstanding talents of our university.",
5391,"All of this combined has resulted in the International Polytechnic Summer Schools powerful development over the past decade,” says Olga EMELYANOVA, head of the Department of International Educational Programs and Academic Mobility.
",
5392,The qualifying round of the Open Doors: Russian Scholarship project project will start very soon; registration will open on September 15.,
5393,Winners of the intellectual competition will have an opportunity to enter Master’s degree or postgraduate programs of leading Russian universities without entrance examinations and study absolutely free (at the expense of the budget of the Russian Federation).,
5394,International students who graduate from Polytechnic University in 2022 may also take part in the Olympiad.,
5395,"If they win the Olympiad, they will have an opportunity to study at the Masters or Postgraduate School of SPbPU at the expense of the Russian Federation budget.,  ",
5396,The Open Doors International Olympiad: Russian Scholarship Project is supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation and Rossotrudnichestvo.,
5397,The organizer of the project is the Global Universities Association.,
5398,"Foreign citizens and stateless persons including compatriots living abroad, who gave their consent for personal data processing, and who have or are about to complete at least Bachelor’s degree for a Master’s degree track and Master’s or Specialist’s level for Ph.D. track can participate in the Olympiad.",

5400,The number of profiles that participants can choose from is growing every year.,
5401,A detailed description of the tracks offered by SPbPU can be found in the university’s official section on the Open Doors Olympiad website in Russian and English.,
5402,"Two tracks are available for participants – Master’s degree and postgraduate courses, as well as a page with a detailed description of the university’s possibilities and a section with video presentations of potential scientific supervisors.",
5403,“I learned about the Open Doors International Olympiad through social media.,
5404,"When choosing a university to study, I was guided by the ratings, as well as by the opinions of friends who already study in Russia.",
5405,"In the Master’s degree program at Polytechnic University, I study roads, bridges, and transport tunnels.",
5406,The specialty I will get is very much in demand in my country.,
5407,I hope that my research will be useful in the development of a new asphalt mix that will reduce the need for frequent road repairs.,
5408,"My country has a huge population growth rate, so progress is necessary.",
5409,One of my favorite subjects is the computer-aided design of roads and bridges.,
5410,My impressions of the instructors are excellent; they have broad scientific knowledge and explain the material clearly and understandably.,
5411,I feel comfortable studying and I got on well with the other students.,
5412,I advise all foreign students to take part in the Open Doors Olympiad.,
5413,"I plan to participate in it this year to continue my postgraduate studies,” shared Ahmed Hamza, an SPbPU student from Yemen.",
5414,“I learned about the Open Doors International Olympiad from a friend who won it a year before I participated.,
5415,"I chose Polytechnic University because it is one of the best technical universities in Russia, and it is also well known abroad.",
5416,The programs taught here are of high quality.,
5417,"Im studying applied mechanics, more specifically, virtual engineering technology.",
5418,"I really like this field, because it connects mechanics and information technology.",
5419,"Using the computer, we solve problems and consider the behavior of various mechanical structures.",
5420,My favorite subjects are continuum mechanics and computer engineering.,
5421,"Teachers try to explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner, give interesting examples and give me lots of additional literature to read for better understanding.",
5422,And they always help me to solve difficult questions!,
5423,I have quickly and easily found a common language with the other students.,
5424,We solve problems together and help each other.,
5425,I advise international students to participate in the Open Doors Olympiad in order to study in the best universities of Russia in the desired program and to become excellent specialists!”,
5426,"said Ricardo Houngue, a student from Benin, SPbPU.",
5427,", The Open Doors International Olympiad is the first project in Russia to attract talented international students to study in the leading Russian universities, covering almost all countries of the world.",
5428,The Olympiad is conducted online in Russian and English in two stages.,
5429,"In the first stage, participants need to submit their portfolios through the special information platform developed on the Olympiad website.",
5430,"At the second stage, participants have to perform olympiad tasks, which will be held in the mode of participant identification and online control.",
5431,"Participants of the postgraduate student track on the results of two stages are interviewed by potential scientific supervisors.
",
5432,Have you ever dreamed of taking a ride in a supercar or flying to Mars in a rocket?,
5433,"How about the idea of talking to the genius of our time, billionaire investor, head of SpaceX and Tesla, engineer and inventor?",
5434,It is quite realistic if you are a Polytechnic University student!,
5435,"On May 21, students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University joined a large-scale educational project, the «New Knowledge» marathon.",
5436,"In a live broadcast, they asked questions to the President’s press secretary Dmitry PESKOV and Ilon MASK.",
5437,The May 20-22 educational marathon had over 40 million views.,
5438,"Starting Thursday in Moscow, it ran in parallel in St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladivostok, Kaliningrad, and Novosibirsk.",
5439,"Each city represented one area of the educational activity (history and culture, sports, science and technology, industry and industry, information technology).",
5440,"The best experts in their fields spoke at the marathon — more than 150 top speakers including Sergei LAUROV, Sergei SHOIGU, Vladimir Pozner, Denis MATSUEV, Vladimir SOLOVYEV, Nikolai TSISKARIDZE, Mikhail KOVALCHUK, Timur BEKMAMBETOV, and many others.",
5441,"Scientists, businessmen, cosmonauts, artists, high-ranking managers, and statesmen did not speak in general terms but shared their personal experiences with students and schoolchildren.",
5442,"Dmitry PESKOV, press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, spoke on «Fake News vs. True Knowledge.»",
5443,The deputy head of the Presidential Administration noted the necessity and importance of knowledge in today’s world: Knowledge gives birth to progress.,
5444,Knowledge gives birth to technology.,
5445,"Technology gives birth to unique things: neural networks, artificial intelligence.",
5446,"They let us understand history, understand the essence of the Universe.",
5447,"A neural network gives us a colored picture, like a video from the World War II archives.",
5448,"We see how our grandfathers defended our homeland from fascism, saved the whole world from fascism.",
5449,We see this restored footage and it’s all beautiful.,
5450,"According to the speaker, fakes are one of the serious threats to modern reality.",
5451,"Therefore, he urged young people to follow digital hygiene and double-check the news.",
5452,How do you fight faknews?,
5453,"With knowledge, persistence, reluctance and unwillingness to take everything for the truth.",
5454,"Be inquisitive, verify any information, make a rule for yourself to follow digital hygiene.",
5455,"Always try to understand why this news, who it is aimed at, who it may benefit.",
5456,And whether it’s good or bad.,
5457,"And I wish you success in this information, digital and scientific hygiene, be daring, be inquisitive, the whole world is open to you, said Dmitry PESKOV.",
5458,"Andrey SHAVVA, a senior lecturer of the Civil Engineering Institute, got a chance to ask the press secretary of the President of Russia a question about the main qualities of a communicator.",
5459,"According to Dmitry PESKOV, these are professionalism, efficiency, and honesty.",
5460,"When asked by Alexandra DIVENKO, a first-year student of the Institute of Computer Science and Technology, how he felt about the fact that now anyone can become a newsmaker, the presidential press secretary unexpectedly replied that he was «very positively.»",
5461,"However, he added: Knowledge and information is a marketplace.",
5462,There is supply and demand.,
5463,"And if you offer the market your knowledge and news, and there is a demand for it, and it’s all within the current law, then just go ahead!",
5464,"Concluding his speech, Dmitry PESKOV wished success to the youth and drew attention to the fact that all participants of the marathon «New Knowledge» are guys «with shining eyes», smart, serious, but also with a sense of humor.",
5465,"And this was demonstrated by a second-year student of the Institute of Engineering, Materials and Transport Bulat Baishev, as soon as Dmitry PESKOV introduced the star speaker of the marathon — American billionaire and inventor Elon MUSK.",
5466,The young man reminded the head of Space X and Tesla of the words from an interview in which he called himself an alien from the future.,
5467,The student asked Musk to prove that he was... alien.,
5468,You mentioned in your interview that you were an alien from the future.,
5469,How can you prove this fact?,
5470,the young man asked.,
5471,"In response, Ilon Musk laughed and guffawed, Isn’t it obvious?",
5472,"Oh, I joke a lot, and people often ask me if I’m an alien.",
5473,Of course I’m an alien!,
5474,"It’s just that I work with technology, replied Elon Musk.",
5475,"There were dozens of questions for him: about space, education, green energy, the future that awaits us in 50 years, about alien civilizations.",
5476,Musk noted that the world is waiting for big changes.,
5477,They will affect space travel and DNA research.,
5478,"All vehicles, except rockets, will be electric and equipped with autopilot.",
5479,"In addition, the American inventor believes that first, a base should appear on Mars, and then the city.",
5480,He also admitted that he likes to read science fiction and expressed hope for stronger ties between the U. S. and Russia.,
5481,"I admire Russian achievements, as well as Soviet achievements in the rocket sphere, Musk added.
",
5482,"Are you interested in going to study abroad, but do not know where to start?",
5483,"We turned for help to students of Polytechnic University, who have been to leading partner universities of SPbPU for a semester.",
5484,"Polina BORIS, Julia PERFILOVA and Julia KAMZINA answered questions that the coordinators of the Erasmus+ Program are often asked.",
5485,Why is it worth participating in an exchange semester?,
5486,What difficulties occur in the preparation process?,
5487,What do you feel in the first days in another country?,
5488,Is it easy to adapt?,
5489,What sights are worth seeing?,
5490,What do students who are just about to study abroad need to know?,
5491,Read about this and not only in the stories of our students.,
5492,"Polina Boris, University of Stuttgart (Germany)",
5493,"At SPbPU I study foreign regional studies, and the region of my specialization is Germany.",
5494,It was very important for me to get the experience of intercultural communication and to “probe the ground” for the future: I have plans to come to Germany to study at the graduate school.,
5495,Preparations for the trip took about six months.,
5496,"There were no big difficulties: if you are organized enough to independently solve the problems related to visa issuance and submitting documents, then everything will go without problems.",
5497,"There were some surprises: for example, two days before departure, I found out that I could not immediately upon arrival check into the dormitory, as I was arriving too late.",
5498,"But in the end, everything was safely resolved!",
5499,"Upon arrival, I had a whole palette of emotions and impressions.",
5500,"The first week was just crazy: get on the registration account, enroll as a student, open a bank account...",
5501,Germany teaches you to plan time by minutes!,
5502,"The Germans themselves seemed to me rather closed people, and my adaptation was not as easy as I hoped.",
5503,"But after a month and a half it passed, and I realized how great it was there!",
5504,I liked the University of Stuttgart right away.,
5505,The classrooms are well equipped with all kinds of devices.,
5506,Teachers are able to make you interested; literature and materials necessary for studying are available online.,
5507,I must say right away that learning is not easy: lectures are given in German quite different from the one I taught in the courses.,
5508,"At times I even felt desperate, but the support of teachers and other students gave me strength.",
5509,I traveled all over Germany.,
5510,"As you know, it consists of federal lands.",
5511,"Each land is famous for something special, but I advise everyone to visit Berlin: this is an amazing city.",
5512,"And for students who are going to study abroad, I advise to be patient: this is a serious test, but at the same time, an invaluable experience.",
5513,"Julia Perfilova, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (Finland) I went to study in Finland for many reasons: I wanted to improve my English, supplement my degree with certificate of a semester studying abroad, test my capabilities and compare the educational systems of the two countries.",
5514,"I planned the trip to the smallest detail, so I had a lot of questions for the program coordinators.",
5515,Feel free to ask: this helps to avoid difficulties in the preparation process!,
5516,I clearly remember my first emotions.,
5517,"First of all, it was a shock: do I have to speak only English now?",
5518,The second was the fear of the unknown: how would I even go to university tomorrow?,
5519,And finally: how good and calm it is here!,
5520,The Haag-Helia University of Applied Sciences impressed me a lot.,
5521,It is located in a modern high-rise building with huge corridors; there is also a gym and several canteens.,
5522,"At first, I could not believe that this was a university.",
5523,It seemed like I was in a museum of modern art.,
5524,I can’t say that I easily adapted to the new environment; I guess this was mostly about my own character.,
5525,"The teachers did everything to help us adapt: they arranged orientation weeks, gave tickets to various events, organized trips and group work.",
5526,"A month later, I felt completely comfortable.",
5527,The grading system at the Finnish University is peculiar: from 1 to 5 points.,
5528,"Even if you get 1 point, the discipline is credited.",
5529,"A lot of time is allotted to working in groups, performances and presentations.",
5530,The teachers pay great attention to practices.,
5531,"I enjoyed learning new programs, for example, how to describe business processes and create videos.",
5532,"As for tourist attractions, I recommend visiting the National Museum in Helsinki and the unique Oodi Library.",
5533,It has absolutely everything: from books to virtual reality helmets and 3D printers.,
5534,"They can be used free of charge, you only need to book in advance.",
5535,"And for all students who plan to study abroad, I advise not to be afraid of the language barrier, leave your comfort zone, ask questions, even if they seem silly, and collect documents in advance.",
5536,Everything will definitely work out!,
5537,"Julia Kamzina, Sultan Mehmet Fatih University (Turkey)",
5538,I was always attracted by the opportunity to communicate with people from different countries.,
5539,"I have been participating in the international activities of Polytechnic University for quite some time: I helped to coordinate the International Polytechnic Summer and Winter Schools in Energy, was a volunteer at the celebration of the 120th anniversary of Polytechnic University, accompanied one of the foreign delegations.",
5540,I have long been considering the opportunity to participate in the exchange semester.,
5541,"When I saw Turkey on the list of possible countries, I was surprised and delighted.",
5542,"I like the atmosphere and history of Istanbul, so I went there.",
5543,But at first I had to wait for quite some time for confirmation from the Turkish university.,
5544,"It was the only difficulty: when they confirmed my participation, then everything went easy.",
5545,"Turkey is a visa-free country for Russians, so I just flew to Istanbul, and already on the spot the staff of the university’s international office and volunteers helped me with applying for a residence permit, insurance and other documents.",

5552,"Therefore, most of the classes were individual.",
5553,The international office arranged for us for a wonderful trip to the island of Bozcaada.,
5554,"In Istanbul, the main attraction for me is the Bosphorus.",
5555,"I really like to cross it on a ferry, drink tea in a cafe or just sit on the promenade and watch the ferries, flocks of gulls, and waves passing by.",
5556,"To students who plan to go to study under the Erasmus+ program, I advise to stop doubting and act.",
5557,"An exchange semester is an incredible experience that is really worth living through.

5745,"- Lokesh, how long have you lived in Russia?",
5746,What do you remember?,
5747,- I lived in Russia for a year while I was studying for my masters degree.,
5748,I loved it very much!,
5749,"Life was amazing, I enjoyed every day.",
5750,I still miss Russia and want to come back sometime.,
5751,"In general I would like to come to Russia every year, I really like your culture.",
5752,"St. Petersburg is a beautiful city, almost every weekend we went to different parties, it was a lot of fun.",
5753,"In addition to my studies, I was on the dance club team, we participated in the STU DANCE CUP interuniversity dance festival., - Do you think people in Russia and in India are similar?",
5754,"- They are not exactly the same, they have a little bit different culture, but in terms of enjoying life, I think Indians and Russians are the same!",
5755,We similarly enjoy everyday life.,
5756,- Why did you decide to study in Russia?,
5757,- It is because of the program.,
5758,I wanted to study mechatronics and artificial intelligence.,
5759,I researched all the universities around the world that offer this kind of course.,
5760,"And I found this international program at the Leibniz University of Hannover, where the mechatronics course is in Germany and the intelligent systems course is in Russia.",
5761,"The good part of this program is this duality in countries, it gives me extra exposure and extra learning of two different cultures and two different types of education systems as well.",
5762,The second good part for me is that Polytechnic University is highly rated on international education ratings.,
5763,"And, of course, the city: St. Petersburg is a very beautiful city and it is a good place to study.",
5764,- Was it the dual degree program you wanted to study for? -,
5765,"Yes, I wanted exactly a double degree program.",
5766,"You experience two cultures, study a lot of material and get two diplomas – that is an extraordinary opportunity.",
5767,"- Tell us a little about your studies, was it easy to study at Polytechnic University?",
5768,- I would say it was relatively easy.,
5769,"The Russian education system has a good balance, students can study, but they also have time to enjoy life.",
5770,"Also in Russia, the grading and examination system is not as complicated as, for example, in India.",
5771,"I think this is good because while studying you don’t think about grades and final exams, but concentrate on the learning process.",
5772,- What subjects did you enjoy the most?,
5773,"- Most of all I liked the courses of Associate Professor Vadim Onufriev on knowledge engineering, Associate Professor Elena RODIONOVA on optimization methods, and the practice on software development, which was taught by Professor Galina MALYKHINA.",
5774,We received very valuable knowledge in these courses.,
5775,"- And in general, what are your impressions of the Polytechnic teachers?",
5776,"- I noticed that they love their work, the way they teach shows how passionate they are about the subject and the process.",
5777,"Many Russian teachers have a good level of English, which is a big plus.",
5778,"Because if you have a lot of knowledge, but your language skills are not very good, its going to be difficult to convey them in an accessible way., - How did your relationships with your classmates develop?",
5779,"- In our group, there were three students from Russia, and the rest were from other countries.",
5780,"We formed a very warm relationship, we continued to meet and communicate in Hannover.",
5781,- I was lucky to find such friends!,
5782,- What was your Master’s degree thesis about?,
5783,-,
5784,My thesis topic was “An improved SLAM system for autonomous vehicles”.,
5785,"Autonomous vehicles can be driven by themselves, they are also known as self-driven cars, for example, Tesla and other companies.",
5786,And SLAM is known as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.,
5787,It helps to understand the path of the car that is going on the road without a driver and the map around it.,
5788,It is a very complex process.,
5789,So my thesis was describing the problems of the SLAM algorithm and I improved this algorithm by few points.,
5790,"- I plan to work in Germany and Europe, I already work with Volkswagen on their self-driven cars, so I practice all knowledge I got in Russia and in Germany.",
5791,"I want to get industrial work experience and implement all my artificial intelligence, deep and machine learning knowledge, and then I would like to start my own business in the field of artificial intelligence.",
5792,But it will take some time.,
5793,- What advice do you have for students who want an international education?,
5794,- There are some things that I wish I could have done better.,
5795,"In Russia, you will have a lot of time to do self-study unlike in Germany, where things are strict.",
5796,"There you will have to spend time on your courses and studies, but in Russia, you got time.",
5797,"So instead of having a rest too much, which I did, I think you have to have a balance.",
5798,"It’s better to work on some real-world projects while you study, to implement what you have learned at the same time in some projects.",
5799,Then you will be able to list them on your resume or CV.,
5800,"It should be some real-world projects, not copied from someone.",
5801,"For example, you solve a problem, make mobile phone applications, etc.",
5802,"It can be not a big project, but a real one.",
5803,"Then you will have some experience that you will need for your future work.

5804,Under the program Erasmus+ a Master’s degree student in Electrical engineering of the Institute of Energy of SPbPU Anna PETROVA has studied at Politecnico di Milano for a semester and on arrival shared her impressions.,
5805,"Today in our interview: how to take part in Erasmus+ programs, what documents are necessary, what educational process there is at Politecnico di Milano and lots of other interesting facts.",
5806,"- Anna, why did you decide to take part in Erasmus+ program?",
5807,"- I have been studying English language since my early childhood, it is my true passion.",
5808,Finding an opportunity to combine my professional studies with my English knowledge was one of my dreams.,
5809,But all along my bachelor degree the idea of going to a foreign university elicited fear.,
5810,"During my first semester I realized that if I did not catch the last chance, probably I would loose it forever.",
5811,I applied without hesitation despite knowing how many barriers I was going to face.,
5812,"- What university did you choose, and why?",
5813,-,
5814,"My target was Politecnico di Milano, Italy.",
5815,This particular country is my true passion!,
5816,"Having been here as a tourist I was under a great impression of the culture, architecture, food and people.",
5817,Thanks to the exchange program my wish of living in Italy came true.,
5818,- Tell us about the preparation for leaving.,
5819,- Preparation for leaving for another country implies a number of milestones.,
5820,"One needs to be ready to spend a lot of time on pursuing the necessary documents, filling out the forms and communicating with the accountable.",
5821,Bureaucratic issues are the most crucial and tiresome.,
5822,Another key point that should be thought of in advance is the accommodation.,
5823,"Such a European country as Italy is quite expensive, so its better to start finding a place to stay in advance, otherwise it will cost a fortune., - Do you remember your first day in Italy?",
5824,- I remember the day of my arrival as if it was yesterday.,
5825,I was so excited and happy...,
5826,"However, my first day ended with a couple of problems – I had to tackle in my dorm I had booked: the door was broken so I had to negotiate a lot with the administration, I experienced disappointment because of troubles.",
5827,Also there was a pile of documentation waiting to be signed.,
5828,"To sum up, the first days in a foreign country as a student are full of contingencies.",
5829,- Did you like the university?,
5830,-,
5831,The university impressed me a lot.,
5832,"No disinterested professors; cutting edge technologies, spacious lecture rooms and friendly spirit inspired me from the first lecture.",
5833,"The thing I liked the most was the fact that the professors never strayed from the topic during lessons, therefore the precious time was never lost.",
5834,- Was is difficult to get used to new university?,
5835,"- Polimi is a university with a high share of international students, so I was never a black sheep.",
5836,"Every lesson ended with new acquaintances, I didnt even need to try to start the conversation because practically every time there was someone who was coming up to me to have a talk.",
5837,"People around rendered interest in being out of the box and making new friends, the whole university ambience promoted interconnections and experience exchange., - Tell us about the studying process.",
5838,Is there anything the other international students should pay attention?,
5839,-,
5840,Once did the lessons start I realized that a high rated European university had a number of difficulties in disguise.,
5841,The main one was the education itself.,
5842,"The amount of studies, project works and new information turned out to be extra large.",
5843,"Polimi provides its students with exceptionally interesting subjects, the professors often invite external specialists to let the young keep up with the situation in the sphere they are interested in, the workshops and case projects suggested as a homework help to master basic principles taught during the lessons.",
5844,BUT!,
5845,All the lectures need a rebound effect from the student.,
5846,"For this very reason here, in Polimi, I realized that to survive you need to study from the very beginning, otherwise you will gain problems.",
5847,"Thereby, the university infrastructure favors studying: there are many study and recreation areas, special study rooms, libraries, virtual platforms, zones equipped with all the necessary appliances for a student to study, study, study... -",
5848,Did you have chance to travel around the country?,
5849,- I enjoyed my stay in Milan owing to many Erasmus network organizations which were in charge of evening activities for students.,
5850,They assembled a large number of people from all over Milan and provided services and events for them.,
5851,"Several times a week they offered free aperitivo and buffet, which is typical for Milan.",
5852,These events were my favorite ones because when youre abroad (especially in Milan) you appreciate each and every opportunity to save money and eat without paying for it.,
5853,"Moreover, excursions and city tours were organized, so we could visit museums, theaters, exhibitions, clubs, even football matches either for free or at a significantly discounted price.",
5854,"During my first months, when the density of studies was not so high, I managed to travel to Como, Lecco, Varenna, Sirmione, Verona, Venice, Bari, Hamburg and Luneburg (thanks to discounted Flixbus and Ryanair tickets offered to Erasmus students)., - Would you recommend other students to take part in Erasmus+ Program?",
5855,"- I strongly recommend to apply for an exchange program because it is an unforgettable experience which can help one to expand the comfort zone, upgrade his or her skills and find new friends!",
5856,"- Anna, thank you very much for a very interesting interview!",
5857,"Wish you good lick and new achievements!

5876,"SPbPU rector Andrei RUDSKOI and the Secretariat of the Russian-Austrian Public Forum “Sochi dialogue” were among the initiators of its creation.
",
5877,The Institute of Humanities (SPbPU) keeps up to date and trains specialists in demand both in Russia and abroad.,
5878,"This year, the Graduate School of Language Education and Translation of the Institute had released its first Masters degree graduates in the educational program “Methods of teaching Russian as a foreign language and intercultural communication”.",
5879,"The program opens up great opportunities for those who are going to connect life with teaching Russian as a foreign language and want to promote our language and culture around the world.,",
5880,"As part of the program, students learn two foreign languages.",
5881,"The first is English, the second (optional) may be German, French or Spanish.",
5882,"In addition to the theory and methodology of teaching Russian as a foreign language, the core disciplines include language and intercultural communication, linguistic analysis and interpretation of the text, communication strategies in intercultural communication, business discourse of a foreign language and others.",
5883,"The program is in demand not only among Russian students, but also among international students: the list of successful graduates includes students from China, France and Algeria.",
5884,The guys were happy to tell us about their impressions on the program.,
5885,"Zhang XUAY (China): I dreamed of becoming a teacher of Russian language, because in China it is a very promising and well-paid profession.",
5886,And I am glad that Polytechnic University became the platform for the implementation of my dreams.,
5887,There are wonderful teachers here; they are real professionals in their field.,
5888,"I am grateful to the teachers of our graduate school for creating all conditions for productive study, helping us get used to Russia and enjoy its multifaceted culture.",
5889,"A few days ago I successfully defended my master\s degree thesis, and my plans are to enter the postgraduate course at the Humanitarian Institute.",
5890,"Wang LINPEN (China): Like most of the guys on my stream, I plan to link my life to teaching Russian.",
5891,"I was interested in the educational program - rich, useful, and there is nothing unnecessary.",
5892,It\s great that our higher school has a club for foreigners Polylink.,
5893,"While studying in St. Petersburg every week we went on excursions together - we studied this book city, visited exhibitions and theatres.",
5894,I will also often remember the Pancake Week at Polytech - a colorful and incredibly tasty holiday.,
5895,"We danced at our hearts’ desire, ate pancakes and enjoyed the bright traditions of Russian culture.",
5896,"If you ask me, do I advise a Master\s degree program at Polytechnic University?",
5897,My answer is definitely yes!”,
5898,Sabrina SADUDI (Algeria): I\ve always been attracted to Russia:,

5903,"Knowledge makes a person truly rich, which means that you should try to miss no opportunities to learn from the best and advance in your work of love”.
",
5904,"Yukti SHARMA clearly knows what she wants: while still living in India, she decided to enter a foreign university for a double degree program.",
5905,No sooner said than done.,
5906,"Yukti enrolled in the “Mechatronics” international program at Leibniz University of Hannover (LUH; Germany); however, she started with coming to Polytechnic University, where she is currently studying intelligent systems.",
5907,"How Yukti ended up at a Russian university, studying computer science and electrical engineering, and the advantages of double degree programs, read in our interview.",
5908,"- Yukti, glad to see you!",
5909,You have made a long way to come to Polytechnic University.,
5910,"Tell us, what do you study at our university?",
5911,"Here at Polytechnic University, I study under the “Intelligent systems” program and plan to pursue a Master’s degree in computer science and engineering.",
5912,"This program runs in conjunction with a course in Germany: after completing the two of them, I will receive two degrees at once.",
5913,- Leibniz University of Hannover and Polytechnic University are long-term strategic partners.,
5914,"Tell us, did you aim to get two degrees right away?",
5915,-,
5916,"Yes, I originally wanted to enter a double degree program.",
5917,"Before entering a German university, I did a lot of research.",
5918,I liked the lines of study offered by both LUH and SPbPU.,
5919,"Already in St. Petersburg, I began to learn more about the educational programs of Russian universities and realized that a lot of students from India come to Russia to study in various areas, such as IT technologies, medicine, business, and others.",
5920,- What is the advantage of the double degree program for you?,
5921,-,
5922,The main thing for me is that I can work and collaborate with a large number of people from completely different industries.,
5923,"For example, here at Polytechnic University I work with people from the field of computer science, and in Germany I will work with people from the field of mechanical engineering or electrical engineering.",
5924,Dual degree programs create a diverse environment.,
5925,"I think that in the era of global technologies, robotics and computer science, it is essential to know not only the details of one specific subject, but other areas too.",
5926,- How is your training organized?,
5927,How do you deal with a large volume of work?,
5928,- Everything is conveniently planned out.,
5929,"I study here at Polytechnic University for a year, and then I will go to Leibniz University of Hanover.",
5930,"A minor obstacle is that I received my Bachelor’s degree in electronics, now I am studying computer science, and in Germany I will study mechanics and electronics.",
5931,But the support of the teachers helps a lot!,
5932,-,
5933,What do you do in class?,
5934,Do you have any project activities?,
5935,- We have a lot of laboratory work and projects.,
5936,"Within each subject, we have a term paper or term project.",
5937,"Our teachers prepare us for a variety of oral exams, interviews, and the final qualification work.",
5938,"The main focus is on the latter work, which I am going to defend upon graduation.",
5939,The subjects that I study here are not only theoretical; I also know how to apply my knowledge in practice.,
5940,"I must admit that here, at Polytechnic University, study consists of practical work rather than theoretical work, and this is very important.",
5941,- What disciplines do you like the most?,
5942,-,
5943,My favorite classes are those taught by Professor Vadim ONUFRIEV: he teaches “Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management”.,
5944,"This topic was completely new to me, but the professor’s lectures were so wonderful that I had no problems understanding the material.",
5945,This course is combined with the discipline named “Software Development Technologies.”,
5946,Professor Onufriev teaches it as well.,
5947,"As part of this subject, we had practical and design work, which made it possible to put into practice the skills gained from the engineering knowledge course.",
5948,-,
5949,What is your opinion about exams?,
5950,Is it usually hard to take them?,
5951,-,
5952,My principle is to diligently work throughout the semester.,
5953,This makes you feel much easier during the examination session.,
5954,"It’s not difficult for me at the exams per se, but during the semester the work can be quite intense.",
5955,I pass the exams without ruffle or excitement! -,
5956,Are you satisfied with your education?,
5957,-,
5958,"Yes, overall I am satisfied.",
5959,It’s a bit of a pity that in the second semester we had a lot of online classes: I prefer face-to-face training more.,
5960,But I understand that due to the current situation in the world there is simply no other way out.,
5961,We all faced new realities.,
5962,We had to adapt to learning online - both students and teachers.,
5963,- How has your studies changed during the pandemic?,
5964,-,
5965,"As I said, everything has moved online.",
5966,But I still think I was quite lucky.,
5967,"I study computer science at Polytechnic University, and for me it’s essential to have a computer at home.",
5968,"I hope that by the time I go to Germany, the quarantine measures will not be tightened, and the students will have the opportunity to study in person.",
5969,"I cannot imagine remote laboratory work in the field of mechanics and electronics - in such situations, students should be present in the laboratory!",
5970,-,
5971,What advice would you give to students who are thinking about entering SPbPU?,
5972,-,
5973,The most important thing I can advise is to take courses in the study of the Russian language.,
5974,It was the language aspect that became the most difficult for me.,
5975,"My Master’s program is entirely in English, but whenever I go out into the street, I understand that not too many people in St. Petersburg speak English.",
5976,"At the very least, it is worth studying basic knowledge of the Russian language before entering the university.",
5977,"This will help you communicate with employees in dorms, shops, shopping malls, and so on.",
5978,"St. Petersburg is a very beautiful city, I recommend everyone to visit it.",
5979,"While I was studying at Polytechnic University, I had the opportunity to go to Moscow – it’s great there too.",
5980,"In general, I want to say that life in Russia has become an interesting and rewarding experience for me.",
5981,"- Yukti, thanks for the interesting interview!",
5982,"We wish you good luck and success on your life path!

6058,-,
6059,"If you compare online training and face-to-face format, which is closer to you?",
6060,- It depends on how you look at it.,
6061,The full-time format gives a lot of opportunities for intercultural communication.,
6062,"It is easier to communicate with other students, to work in groups.",
6063,"On the other hand, when you study remotely, all classes are recorded.",
6064,"If I doubt whether I learned the material correctly, I can simply review the lecture again.",
6065,"Besides, studying online allows me to arrange my schedule flexibly.",
6066,"For example, I continue to take classes at my university in Germany, but at the same time, I am also studying at Polytechnic University.",
6067,-,
6068,"And then, in the summer, where did you find information about our university?",
6069,-,
6070,On one of the educational portals.,
6071,I needed a course in entrepreneurship for my resume.,
6072,"I was looking for suitable programs, and I saw Polytechnic University.",
6073,And I thought - and why not?,
6074,-,
6075,And you often take part in summer and winter schools?,
6076,-,
6077,"Yes, if I get the opportunity, I try to use it.",
6078,"I have already been to China, Finland, Norway.",
6079,"In Norway, by the way, I also took a course on big data.",
6080,- We can’t help but ask you for feedback.,
6081,What are the similarities and differences between the courses in Norway and Russia?,
6082,-,
6083,"In Norway, the program lasted longer, about a month.",
6084,"Respectively, we studied more subjects, and the tasks themselves were more extensive.",
6085,"On the other hand, in Russia, we were taught subjects that we did not have at the Norwegian university.",
6086,"Thus, I was able to expand my knowledge in this field considerably.",
6087,- Why is it important for today’s students to participate in such programs?,
6088,"- I think that, first of all, it allows you to retake some disciplines at your home university.",
6089,"Secondly, it is a unique opportunity to gain valuable experience in intercultural communication and teamwork.",
6090,"Which, by the way, very few students can get.",
6091,-,
6092,Whether your expectations from studying at the International Polytechnic Winter School were justified?,
6093,"- Absolutely, yes.",
6094,"I had the task to learn new and useful information, to work in an international team on an interesting project - and I got it all.",
6095,- How was the teamwork organized at Polytechnic University?,
6096,-,
6097,"As I said, we had an international team with guys from different countries.",
6098,The work was organized in the format of Agile: an interactive approach to work on the project.,
6099,"We were constantly in touch, discussing problems, solving problems.",
6100,I think we did very well.,
6101,"- In your opinion, is it difficult to work together on a project online?",
6102,"- Of course, there are more difficulties than in the traditional format of interaction, but they are all solvable.",
6103,The key problem is the difference in time zones; it is important to take this into account when organizing work.,
6104,I already had the experience of working remotely in software development for a company in Denmark.,
6105,I can’t say that online and offline formats were very different for me.,
6106,-,
6107,What advice do you have for other students who are planning to take part in summer and winter schools?,
6108,"- If you get the chance, make sure you take it.",
6109,"You will get an important experience of intercultural communication, get to know a new country, its culture, traditions, people.",
6110,"All in all, nothing but good!",
6111,"- Daniel, thank you for the interesting interview!",
6112,"May all your tasks and goals come true for sure!
",
6113,"The admission campaign for the recruitment of international students to Polytechnic University for the 2019/2020 academic year continues; however, an intermediate result can already be summed up.",
6114,"To date, managers of the Admission Office for international students have accepted and processed more than 2,700 applications from applicants from 120 countries willing to study in various educational programs of St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.",
6115,"Extensive interest in the educational programs of Polytechnic University is shown this year by applicants from the CIS countries; SPbPU educational lines are traditionally very popular among the African countries (Egypt, Cameroon, Algeria) and Asian states (China, India, Iran, Pakistan).",
6116,"Applicants from such faraway countries as Honduras, Japan, Guatemala, Panama, Nepal and South Korea have also applied for training at Polytechnic University.",
6117,"As part of the quota for training established by the RF Government, SPbPU selected 236 people from over 80 countries.",
6118,"This year, a particular interest is registered from countries of Latin America, Asia, Africa and the CIS.",
6119,"Information technology, software engineering, heat and power engineering, economics and humanities are on the top demand of the students-to-be.",
6120,"«Throughout the year, employees of the international services and institutes of Polytechnic University are intensively working to attract gifted international applicants to our university.",
6121,In our arsenal we have successful practices tested by time: participation in major international educational exhibitions and events; cooperation with leading recruiting companies; development of international inter-university partnerships plus some absolutely new tools.,
6122,"Last year, we launched an advertising campaign on international social networks.",
6123,"This year, based on the results of our analysis, we improved our advertising strategy and covered new regions,» says the head of the International Education Office E.v. SATALKINA.",
6124,SPbPU is actively developing cooperation with Rosatom State Corporation and Akkuyu Nücleer.,
6125,"This year, 23 candidates applied for graduate programs at the Institute of Energy and Transport Systems.",
6126,"And the pioneer students of the large-scale joint Russian-Turkish project of Akkuyu NPP, next fall will study in their fourth grade.",
6127,"In addition, the recruitment of international nationals in the line of Rosfinmonitoring also continues.",
6128,"This year, there is a significant increase among those wishing to study in the programs of University Foundation Program: 850 international nationals submitted their applications.",
6129,"Over 1850 applicants applied for the undergraduate, specialist, graduate, and postgraduate training programs.",
6130,"Of those, 145 people chose to study in English language international educational programs of Polytechnic University.",
6131,"Traditionally, on high students’ demand remain the areas of electric power engineering, civil engineering, information technology, mechanical engineering and new materials, economics, management and linguistics.",
6132,"Altogether, over 140 international aspirants have applied to the Institute of Computer Science and Technology; about the same amount will study at the Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Materials and Transport.",
6133,"This year, the Institute of Industrial Management, Economics and Trade became the undisputed leader among international students: more than 680 people submitted their applications for admission.",
6134,The first stage of entrance tests for international citizens is over.,
6135,"The second wave of exams started in August, and international applicants still have time to submit their documents.",
6136,"The admission campaign for the recruitment of international citizens to SPbPU for the 2019/2020 academic year will last until September 4, 2019.",
6137,"More details of the admission procedure are presented in the relevant section of the official SPbPU website.
",
6138,"The online format was a challenge for the coordinators, teachers, and participants of the Russian Language and Culture program at the International Polytechnic Winter School 2021.",
6139,"For many years, the educational module included such important components as communication with native speakers in real-life situations, visits to historical sites and places of interest, which provided a deep immersion in the language environment.",
6140,"Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the coordinators had to exclude some elements of the program.",
6141,"Nevertheless, 10 international students from China, Italy, Germany and France joined the online classes in order to master the basics of the Russian language and get acquainted with the peculiarities of Russian culture during two intense weeks.",
6142,All classes are interactive in small groups and are built on constant communication with teachers and other students.,
6143,"It is this approach, according to the organizers, that is necessary to obtain key skills and successful assimilation of the material.",
6144,The cultural program also takes place in a modified format.,
6145,"For example, participants took a virtual tour of the Polytechnic University campus, joined online events devoted to Russian traditions and features of modern life in Russia, and walked around the Hermitage in real time.",
6146,"International students are greatly supported by tutors, who help them improve their conversational skills in Russian in an informal atmosphere.",
6147,“Holding an online winter school on Russian language and culture is no easy task.,
6148,"How can you feel the flavor of Russian winter not at the skating rink in a winter park, escaping the cold with herbal tea and ruddy pancakes?",
6149,"After all, it is largely because of immersion in a cultural environment that foreign students go to St. Petersburg to study Russian.",
6150,"Polytechnic teachers have put all their skills, their soul into the preparation of the program.",
6151,"And the start has already shown that it will be successful, said Victor KRASNOSHCHEKOV, Director of the Higher School of International Educational Programs.
",
6152,"A few days ago, an international online intensive course, the final course of the International Polytechnic Summer School 2020 ended at the Higher School сof Technological Entrepreneurship (HSIE) of the Institute of Advanced Production Technologies (IAPT) of the SPbPU NTI Center.",
6153,Its participants were international students from 10 countries.,
6154,Two of them - Nina von TRESCKOW from Hamburg University of Applied Science (Germany) and Jack GILLMAN from Bangor University (England) - met with the SPbPU International Office employees online to tell how they felt about the role of technological entrepreneurs.,
6155,"About the stages of business development, building a unique environment of technological and harmonious development, read in our interview. - Nina, Jack, good to see you!",
6156,Tell us how you found out about the Entrepreneurship and Technology Leadership course and why you decided to take it?,
6157,Nina:,
6158,Last year my friend took this very course and recommended it to me.,
6159,And I studied a similar course in Moscow during my exchange studies.,
6160,"I was interested in comparing teaching styles not only between Germany and Russia, but also between Moscow and St. Petersburg.",
6161,Jack:,
6162,"Initially I was supposed to go to an international course in Japan, but it was canceled.",
6163,My university offered me a scholarship so that I could study at any summer school around the world.,
6164,"The International Polytechnic Summer School of SPbPU was the only one where I was interested in the course, so I chose Polytechnic University.",
6165,- You have participated in similar projects before?,
6166,Nina:,
6167,"Yes, last year I studied at Lomonosov Moscow State University for a semester.",
6168,It was a wonderful experience - I studied economics and business management.,
6169,"After Moscow I really wanted to visit Saint Petersburg - unfortunately, because of coronavirus it proved to be impossible to do it, but I plan that in the future I will be able to come here in person.",
6170,Jack:,
6171,Last year I received a scholarship to study in the Netherlands.,
6172,"It was a summer school course at the University of Utrecht, for a week I studied marketing and entrepreneurship.",
6173,- What did you study in the course “Entrepreneurship and technological leadership” at Polytechnic University?,
6174,Nina: The course has two parts.,
6175,"The first one is theoretical, where we learned basic information necessary for our work.",
6176,"In the second part, we had to apply all this in our own project.",
6177,"For example, teachers told us about the theory of the value proposition, how it works, and what we needed it for.",
6178,Then we had to develop a plan with all the information we needed to narrow down our target audience.,
6179,"This way, all theoretical knowledge was immediately put into practice.",
6180,Jack: I want to add that we worked in teams.,
6181,Each team was given code words and we had to try to come up with a business idea based on them.,
6182,"And then we started to study marketing, promotion, and advertising.",
6183,We also learned about different business models that we could use.,
6184,"Later on, the teams made presentations of their ideas, talked about market features, tools that can be used to bring a company to market, and so on.",
6185,- Is it easy for you to study online??,
6186,"Nina: I am not a big fan of online learning, but I understand that at the moment there is simply no other option.",
6187,I am impressed with how well Polytech has organized online training.,
6188,"Before that, I had no experience working with MS Teams.",
6189,Jack:,
6190,In the UK there are many schools that work only online - personal meetings are not provided there in principle.,
6191,"I don’t like this approach too much, I like live communication and prefer to study in person.",
6192,But now I am quite satisfied with the online format.,
6193,- What are your impressions of Polytechnic University teachers?,
6194,Nina:,
6195,"They have deep knowledge and are happy to share it, especially if you ask the right questions.",
6196,"Of course, it’s not easy for them now, because we are all online, and this has an impact on communication.",
6197,"But at the same time, teachers have done everything they can to support students.",
6198,"We could contact them almost any time, and they would give us advice and answer questions.",
6199,Jack: They are just amazing!,
6200,I emailed many people and discussed course topics.,
6201,Some of the models I learned about at Polytechnic University were not told about to us in the UK.,
6202,"And one of the organizers of the program studied in Cambridge, where I have many friends.",
6203,"She shared her study and work experience with us, and it was very good.",
6204,- How do you plan to use the knowledge gained in SPbPU in your future career and life?,
6205,Nina: It depends on what career I choose.,
6206,But just having a theoretical basis in the field of entrepreneurship is very useful.,
6207,"For example, if you know your target audience, you can certainly offer them what they want and need.",
6208,This knowledge can be applied in different spheres of life.,
6209,Jack: I already use it: I have consulted about 20 companies so far.,
6210,I give recommendations on the choice of business models and also am implementing several marketing projects.,
6211,- Would you like to visit St. Petersburg and SPbPU and take part in the Summer School in real life?,
6212,Nina:,
6213,"Absolutely, yes!",
6214,It was my dream.,
6215,"We wanted to come to St. Petersburg with friends, get a lot of emotions from studying, the city, Russian culture.",
6216,So I would really like to come to Russia.,
6217,Jack: That would be fantastic!,
6218,"Unfortunately, this year the trip is impossible because of the coronavirus, but in the future I plan to come to Russia. -",
6219,"In your opinion, what is the value of summer schools for students??",
6220,Nina:,
6221,"It is a unique experience, a great way to get acquainted with other cultures, teaching methods, educational materials, and the opportunity to work with people from different countries.",
6222,I would certainly recommend that everyone take this chance!,
6223,Jack: I would say that two key points are the knowledge and experience we get when we communicate with different people.,
6224,"Summer schools create a multinational community, which creates an absolutely incredible exchange of knowledge.",
6225,Many people have experiences that you would never have thought of.,
6226,It allows you to think about what you’ve been through yourself and how you’re developing as a person.,
6227,"Also, summer schools help you implement your ideas based on both unique experiences and new information provided at lectures.",
6228,"- Nina, Jack, thank you for an interesting interview!",
6229,"We wish you success and new achievements!
",
6230,Jolanda CUCUZZA is studying in Rome at Sapienza Università di Roma (Italy).,
6231,"This winter she came to Polytech under Erasmus+ program, because she wanted to change her way of life for a while and test herself – not only with the knowledge of Russian language, but also to become more independent.",
6232,"Like many other students, Jolanda had to continue her studies remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
6233,"Today in our interview: Russian language studies, getting used to life in Russia, lunch at the northernmost McDonalds in the world and lots of other interesting facts., - Jolanda, glad to see you!",
6234,"Tell us, what are you studying at Sapienza Università di Roma?",
6235,Why did you decide to come to study in Russia?,
6236,-In,
6237,"Italy I study linguistics and intercultural mediation, Russian and French languages, grammar and translation.",
6238,"I decided to study in Russia, because Russian is the main language I study at my home university.",
6239,"Since the very first year of studies, I had a strong desire to get to know this huge country, geographically close, but culturally far from mine.",
6240,"It was also thanks to my teachers that through their stories and their experiences in Russia, they made me to love this country.",
6241,"Besides, I wanted to perfect my Russian way of speaking and I knew that if I immersed myself into that reality, it would have helped me a lot with the speaking and the comprehension.",
6242,- Did you have any problems while preparing to visit Russian university?,
6243,- I didn’t have huge problems.,
6244,The preparation process is longer than difficult.,
6245,"To study abroad you have to be sure which courses you can follow, and you need to receive official documents that have to be signed with a deadline: a visa and a health insurance.",
6246,"In other words, you have to be highly organized.",
6247,"Also, it’s important to keep in contact both with your home university and with the host university -",
6248,Do you remember your first impression of Russia and SPbPU?,
6249,-,
6250,Of course I do!,
6251,"I have arrived in Saint Petersburg the 6th of February in the night, and it was really cold, in fact, the first thing I thought was: “I’m freezing!”",
6252,"Nevertheless, I was fascinated by the snowy landscape.",
6253,"The second thing I thought, in the taxi from the airport to the dormitory, was the largeness of the streets and the highness of the buildings.",
6254,"I immediately understood that St. Petersburg is bigger than Rome, despite Rome is the largest in Italy.",
6255,"Moreover, when I first entered the Polytechnic University, I fell in love with that building!",
6256,"It seemed like a castle, all white, with large chandeliers and stairways.",
6257,"I also thought how comfortable it was, because a campus and the university is really located in five minutes walking from the dormitory!",
6258,- Was it easy to get used to life in new country?,
6259,"- I think it’s never easy to get used to life in a new country, especially in the beginning, where everything surrounds you seems totally new and stranger.",
6260,"Each person should has its time to get used in a new country, in a new life, to find his balance.",
6261,"In this case, you have to focus on what you have to do every day (and you have a lot to do!), without thinking with melancholy about your home country or family, but trying to make them involved for example through video calls, and step by step, that university and all those international friends will become your new home.",
6262,We have built a close relationship with each other!,
6263,- What can you tell about education?,
6264,What courses did you like most of all?,
6265,- Education in Russia is different from education in Italy.,
6266,"For example, here every student is free to choose if he/she wants to follow the lessons or not, you can pass an exam by studying all on your own, with just the books.",
6267,"While in Russia, going to the courses every day is very important: teachers really care about the active participation of the students during the lessons.",
6268,"Another difference I found, usually in my home university the teachers explains an argument, and just talks all the time, while the courses I took part during the Erasmus+ were definitely more interesting, because we were often able to intervene and tell our opinions.",
6269,"Anyways, I liked all the courses I attended, but maybe the one that I liked the most was didactics of Russian language for foreigners speakers.",
6270,"I learnt how to teach the Russian grammar to foreigners, and it was really interesting and educational to know the teaching techniques. -",
6271,What places in Russia did you visit?,
6272,Which of them did you like most of all?,
6273,-,
6274,"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, I was unable to travel within Russia as much as I would have like to.",
6275,"I visited the city center of St. Petersburg, the cathedrals and the Hermitage.",
6276,"In addition, I was able to organize a little trip with my roommate: we went to Murmansk to see the ‘Aurora Borealis’ (Northern Lights) and it was magical!",
6277,"Despite the snow and the very cold weather, it was a stunning experience.",
6278,We also had lunch in the northernmost McDonald’s in the world!,
6279,"Anyways, I really hope to come back to Russia and to deeply know her in all her many facets.",
6280,- How did you continue your studying while the coronavirus pandemic?,
6281,"- My studies while the coronavirus pandemic continued with a much-defined rhythm: we started lessons in the morning until late afternoon with some pauses between lessons, and a break for lunch.",
6282,"At the end of the lessons, we had homework to do for the day after.",
6283,"Our Russian language teacher every now and then sent us links to watch online video tours of different museums in Russia, this experience I really liked.",
6284,- How did your life change with distance learning?,
6285,- I have to admit that studying while the coronavirus pandemic was really comfortable!,
6286,"You just woke up and can connect to online classes from your bedroom, and don’t waste your time on make-up and driving to university!",
6287,"However, during time it became boring because I missed meeting my friends in class, I missed taking coffee with them during the pauses, laughing and joking with them.",
6288,"Anyways, teachers organized the lessons very well to make them interesting, despite everything.",
6289,"Sometimes, it was also funny, because occasionally even pets appeared on camera, and we smiled for little things.",
6290,- What would you advice to students who are planning to study abroad under the Erasmus+ program?,
6291,- I suggest all the students to live and study abroad for a while!,
6292,"I would tell them to study, of course, to be brave, to enjoy every moment, to learn from every experience will come and from every people they will meet, to be curious.",
6293,"Because, as hard as the climb is, the view is wonderful!",
6294,"- Jolanda, thank you for the positive and sincere interview!",
6295,"We wish you success and more unforgettable memories!
",
6296,"Specialists of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University are developing a digital service for personalized design of educational programs «F3 Learning — Future, Fusion, Flexible».",
6297,The unique project is based on the methodology of system engineering of multidisciplinary educational programs for scientific organizations and industrial enterprises.,
6298,The digital service is being created within the Technopolis Polytechnic strategic project of the Priority 2030 program.,
6299,"Svetlana Kalmykova, Director of the Open Education Center at SPbPU, and Marina Bolsunovskaya, Head of the Industrial Data Streaming Systems Laboratory at the New Manufacturing Technologies Center of the National Technological Initiative at SPbPU, spoke about the features of the development and its advantages.",
6300,"— What is the main principle of the digital service for the personalized design of educational programs «Learning F3 — Future, Fusion, Flexible»?",
6301,— Usually educational courses are built on a monolithic principle.,
6302,"In order to obtain certain competencies, it is necessary to go through the educational program of the course as a whole.",
6303,"Our main task was to divide the course into modules — some minimal didactic units, which would be possible to combine into a single constructor or your own personal course.",
6304,"In other words, in order to obtain a certain competence, it is not necessary to take the whole course, prepared in advance by the university.",
6305,The user has the opportunity to choose individual modules within a given program.,
6306,"Thus, everyone will be able to form his/her own specific trajectory, a set of subjects needed to improve the level of qualification.",
6307,"Our approach is to form micro-modules and provide new opportunities for those who want to improve their knowledge, skills and abilities.",
6308,"When choosing a module, the user has a clear idea of what certain competences he will be able to obtain.",
6309,Let’s analyze the situation on a concrete example.,
6310,"Having assessed your starting level in the field of digital competences by yourself or with the help of certain tests, you want to improve it in the field of software.",
6311,"Regarding your level, you choose options to improve your skills.",
6312,Also everyone will be able to acquire additional competencies in addition to the core competencies.,
6313,"For example, software development (software) is accompanied by project work.",
6314,"At the same time with software development skills you get soft skills, namely the ability to work in a team.",
6315,"Or, if you choose a system analysis or design module, you additionally acquire competencies in structuring purpose and functions, and so on.",
6316,"It’s important for us to combine technical competencies and methodology, to connect the micro-modules, which will provide flexibility in training.",
6317,"Thanks to this format, users will be able to combine modules and choose courses provided by different universities.",
6318,"In this case, we are building a kind of networking structure, linking institutes and software platforms.",
6319,— Who is the target audience of the digital service?,
6320,— The target audience is divided into four types.,
6321,"The first is students who have completed a bachelor’s degree and want to upgrade their qualifications during the Master’s degree program, to receive an APE certificate in addition to the diploma of completion of the main program.",
6322,The calculation of the duration of the courses will be formed in such a way that they are not less than the required size for the APE.,
6323,"Second — teachers, many of whom are now mastering digital competencies, soft skills or teaching skills.",
6324,"The third is industrial enterprises, which want additional education, while offering to adjust the educational course to the specific cases and requests of the company.",
6325,Fourth — specialists in various industries who want to get professional retraining.,
6326,Here there is an opportunity to form a one- or two-year course out of micro-modules.,
6327,— What stage is the development of the project at?,
6328,"— At this stage, we developed a methodology and technology for implementing the project.",
6329,"We have created a terms of reference for the digital service, which includes a scenario for the construction of personalized trajectories.",
6330,"Moreover, the scope of skills, digital and creative competencies, which should be presented in the form of a knowledge model, as well as the knowledge structure embedded in the project have already been defined.",
6331,"It is planned that the development stage will be two-tiered — at first we will launch a pilot version with limited functionality, which will not present a large number of courses broken down into micro-modules.",
6332,"Then the program with fuller functionality will be released, allowing to build several programs of additional education, both for our students and for external customers.",
6333,"At the same time, the possibility of using this constructor in the construction of training programs within the framework of digital departments is being worked out.",
6334,— What will the curriculum consist of?,
6335,"— We want to make network education including for the universities, which were not included in the Priority-2030 program, but which would like to use educational courses in the future.",
6336,"For training in technical disciplines it is necessary to take entrance tests, which have different levels: zero, basic, advanced, professional and expert.",
6337,"Depending on the user’s level of knowledge, the platform will determine the necessary degree of complexity of the course.",
6338,"After testing, the structure of the program itself, consisting of micro-modules, will open.",
6339,"If it is necessary to get acquainted with a certain theoretical base, the course may include a greater number of lectures and several practical classes, with obligatory independent work.",
6340,"If a participant chooses an educational module on testing, it consists more of practical exercises.",
6341,"The higher the level of proficiency in a particular subject, the more the amount of new knowledge is reduced, but the number of skills is noticeably increased.",
6342,That is why the role of the practical part of the course will only increase.,
6343,"— Thank you very much for your answers.
",
6344,"On September 10, 2019 at 16:00 Maker Faire Program Director Sabrina Merlo will give a lecture at Polytechnic University.",
6345,"This talk will take a look at some of some Maker Movement platforms, and review critical features that elicit peer-to-peer engagement and “bottom-up” creativity.",
6346,The Maker Movement can be framed around the democratization of tools and technology: a swelling of interest around making because powerful tools have become more inexpensive and accessible.,
6347,But cheap tools do not make a Movement!,
6348,New platforms for peer-to-peer exchange (and the opportunity to make friends and have fun while solving problems) have been at least as critical to this cultural phenomenon as innovations in hardware.,
6349,"Social environments for making run from the physical (makerspaces, hackathons, cultural events like Maker Faire) to the digital (crowdfunding, GitHub, Slack, MeetUp).",
6350,"But no matter the platform, they share a basic appreciation for amateur status, and offer social incentives that encourage a generosity of spirit and a culture of sharing.",
6351,"The lecture is recommended to attend for engineering students, high school students and those who are interested in the Maker Movement.",
6352,"The event will be held in the SPbPU Research Building at the address: 29 Polytechnicheskaya Str, AF, Big Conference Hall.",
6353,The number of seats is limited!,
6354,"You need to register to participate in the lecture.
",
6355,"On September 10, Polytechnic University students got acquainted with the movement of makers.",
6356,"Sabrina MERLO, director of the Maker Faire project at Maker Media in San Francisco, who runs the Maker Faire worldwide network of fair makers, told them about it.",
6357,Sabrina MERLOs lecture was held under the topic of “The Persuasion of DIT: Do It Together”.,
6358,"“No one makes innovative discoveries alone,” says the director of Maker Faire, “those are made in teams.”",
6359,And this is the essence of the makers’ philosophy.,
6360,They are united by a thirst for discovery and a constant need for creativity.,
6361,"They create various mechanisms, devices and simply creative art objects.",
6362,They get together to bring their projects to perfection.,
6363,"They support each others undertakings, and seem to always have some new ideas in stock., “The maker movement is a cultural phenomenon of the 21st century,” explains Sabrina MERLO.",
6364,“Thousands of people annually take part in Maker Faire fairs.,
6365,These are informal events that are fully open to creativity and expression.,
6366,Our fair was once held in the White House in the U.S. - it was in 2014”.,
6367,Everyone can become a maker: there is no need to have engineering or academic degree.,
6368,Everyone who likes doing things with their own hands can join the ranks of inventors.,
6369,"Already today, within the framework of the maker movement, many educational initiatives have arisen, partners in which became leading scientific foundations and educational institutions.",
6370,"At Polytechnic University, many students show interest in making, in particular, the residents of Fablab, an open digital production laboratory.",
6371,The maker movement is a back off from the consumer culture.,
6372,"“In the modern world, we have forgotten how much pleasure you get from doing things with your own hands.",
6373,But the desire to create is inherent in human nature!,
6374,”- explains Sabrina MERLO.,
6375,"No doubt, the goal of the maker movement is not only about self-expression.",
6376,"It is much more essential for inventors to bring benefits, to create truly necessary things.",
6377,"A bright example is the case of Microsoft, which released a contactless controller for video games a few years ago.",
6378,"Makers instantly dismantled the novelty, considered how it works, and added many new options to the invention.",
6379,"In particular, they developed a medical application that measures the activity of movements and can make diagnostics of diseases typical for older people.",
6380,"As a result, the plan of the inventors was appreciated by the management of the company.",
6381,“The maker’s activity is a lot more than just a hobby.,
6382,"Makers created many technologies that the whole world uses nowadays - for example, the first 3D printers, various educational products, and toys.",
6383,"At the same time, they do not seek to build huge corporations, but simply do what they like,” says Sabrina MERLO, and displays the large letters - DIT.",
6384,"“A while ago, in the U.S., the DIY culture was born, where DIY stands for ’Do it yourself.’",
6385,"Makers ‘got over’ this idea and came up with DIT, which means “Do it together.”",
6386,"Over time, this has become our motto, which brilliantly indicates the philosophy of makers.”
",
6387,"Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Polytechnic University is showing high numbers of foreign specialists.",
6388,A total of 270 foreign professors and researchers worked at the university in 2020.,

6457,"Read about how childhood dreams, motivation for self-education and favorite specialty come true in our interview.",
6458,"- Dima, as far as we know, you have been living in Russia for several years.",
6459,Tell us why you chose St. Petersburg?,
6460,- I found myself in St. Petersburg quite unexpectedly.,
6461,"In 2014, representatives of Pskov State University came to our school and invited us to study there.",
6462,"I thought, why not?",
6463,And I agreed.,
6464,"I was preparing to enter Pskov University, went to courses, improved my mathematics and science and applied for the quota of the Russian Government for foreign citizens.",
6465,But then suddenly it turned out that Pskov University did not have my speciality.,
6466,I was advised to choose another university.,
6467,"And what mattered to me was my specialty, not just university, so I chose two random universities in St. Petersburg and two in Moscow without looking.",
6468,I did not even expect to apply to any of them; it seemed to me that it would be extremely difficult to move to St. Petersburg or Moscow.,
6469,But I managed to do it.,
6470,And that Polytechnic University was one of the preeminent universities in Russia.,
6471,- What is your speciality about? -,
6472,Since my early childhood I wanted to become a design engineer.,
6473,"Here, at the Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Materials and Transport, my dream has gradually began to come true.",
6474,"I study in the area of Design and technological support of machine-building industries, I study automotive technology.",
6475,"At first it was not easy to study in the Bachelor’s degree program, but now, in the Master’s degree program, it is much easier.",
6476,"- Speaking about the Master’s degree program, tell us how you found out about the Open Doors Olympiad and why you decided to take part?",
6477,- I started thinking about the Master’s degree program right after completing my Bachelor’s degree program.,
6478,"Here, at Polytechnic University, I was told about the Open Doors Olympiad for foreign students.",
6479,"And once again I thought, why not?",
6480,What will I lose if I try?,
6481,And I decided to take this chance too.,
6482,-,
6483,What disciplines do you like the most?,
6484,"- At this stage, all subjects are in the specialty, so everything is interesting to me.",
6485,"We have a lot of lab work, especially this semester.",
6486,"There are term papers and projects: we are given a technological assignment in the disciplines of our specialty, and we need to come up with a specific design.",
6487,A whole semester is allocated for design.,
6488,"At this time, we work, communicate with the teacher who gives recommendations and advice.",
6489,Most of the assignments in the Master’s degree program are practice-oriented.,
6490,"- As a whole, is it difficult for you to study?",
6491,-,
6492,Sometimes I hear from other students that in the process of learning we are not told everything in detail.,
6493,"For example, for term papers, they simply give assignments, as if they are being thrown into a pool of water, and we must learn to swim ourselves.",
6494,"But personally, I do like this approach.",
6495,"This strongly motivates to self-education, thanks to which knowledge is acquired much better.",
6496,"And if unclear moments arise, you can always seek advice from teachers.",
6497,- How do you plan to apply the acquired knowledge in the future?,
6498,Are you going to work in your speciality?,
6499,- I already do,
6500,and I really like it.,
6501,I plan to continue working in Russia.,
6502,"All the knowledge that I received at Polytechnic University was useful, but it seems to me that I have not yet fully developed in the profession and I continue to work and master my dream speciality.",
6503,- Would you advise other students to participate in the Open Doors Olympiad?,
6504,- Participation in the Olympiad is definitely worth it.,
6505,"Trying is not torture: as I said, you have nothing to lose if you try.",
6506,"If there is a chance, it must be used!",
6507,"- Dima, thank you for the interesting interview!",
6508,"We wish you the fulfillment of your goals and good luck!

6512,"- Andreas, Sydney is 14 thousand kilometers away from St. Petersburg.",
6513,Was it difficult not to shy away from such a long trip?,
6514,"- To resolve to come to Russia, of course, was not an easy thing.",
6515,"For the most part, I had to organize the whole trip myself.",
6516,"But I was lucky: I found a student who had already studied in Russia, and I could check with him on many aspects.",
6517,- How did you know about our school?,
6518,And why did you choose precisely Polytechnic University?,
6519,"- I learned about the International Polytechnic Winter School at my university: somehow, I got a letter in the mail with a description of the programs.",
6520,"In addition to Polytechnic University, I was choosing among four other European universities, and as a result I arrived in St. Petersburg.",
6521,The duration of the program was important to me; I did not want to leave home for a long time.,
6522,I also liked the content of the course.,
6523,"And finally, I wanted to come in winter! -",
6524,"For better or worse, this winter is not cold at all.",
6525,"However, how easily did you adapt to the Russian climate?",
6526,-,
6527,"When I flew here, I thought: “How freezing!”",
6528,But I got used to it pretty soon - I like the cold.,
6529,"Moreover, it is very hot in Australia right now.",
6530,Russia is not the first country where I go in winter.,
6531,"Before that it was in Japan, one of my favorite trips: it was the middle of winter, extremely cold and incredibly beautiful.",
6532,"Strangely enough, in some parts, St. Petersburg reminded me of Japanese cities - recently I was on Vasilyevsky Island, and thought that it was somewhat similar to Japan.",
6533,- That is amazing!,
6534,What else did you manage to see in St. Petersburg?,
6535,- I tried to see as much as possible.,
6536,"Of course, the obligatory cultural program: the Hermitage and the Russian Museum, the Savior on Spilled Blood, the Trinity, St. Isaac’s and Kazan Cathedrals, the Faberge Museum, Nevsky Prospect and the Griboedov Canal Embankment...",
6537,"In addition, I visited the St. Petersburg Water Park, and also went to one of the districts of St. Petersburg, i.e., Parnassus.",
6538,- Far from every foreign student knows how the districts of St. Petersburg are named!,
6539,"Please tell us, what caused such an unusual choice?",
6540,- I study architecture in Australia.,
6541,"I was wondering how modern houses are being built in Russia, to look at a high-rise area.",
6542,I liked it! -,
6543,The course that you chose at the International Polytechnic Winter School is dedicated to civil engineering.,
6544,What are your impressions of the program?,
6545,-,
6546,"As I said, when choosing a course, it was important for me that would correspond with what I study in Australia.",
6547,"So, upon returning, I would be able to credit the ECTSs received here at my university.",
6548,The “Civil Engineering” module was to a big extent devoted to BIM technology.,
6549,This is a very popular and trendy area of study.,
6550,"As part of the course, we learned about information modeling technologies for buildings and structures.",
6551,"No doubt, two weeks is too little for a full immersion into the topic.",
6552,"However, I’ve got a good base, and I can continue on my own.",
6553,- Do you plan to continue studying BIM technology?,
6554,-,
6555,"Yes, absolutely!",
6556,"At the university in Australia, we did not study this area, and the experience I got here is extremely essential.",
6557,"The Winter School of Polytechnic University gave me the opportunity to learn what BIM technologies are, look at the programs, find out how they work, and try them myself.",
6558,"- And before that, have you ever taken part in international educational programs?",
6559,- This is my first experience.,
6560,"I was looking for various exchange programs, and I really enjoyed living in Russia.",
6561,"I met many people from all over the world - from Belgium, Austria, Holland, African countries, from Uzbekistan...",
6562,I have never met anyone from Uzbekistan before!,
6563,This is very cool when you have the opportunity to get acquainted with a new culture and get to know it better.,
6564,I am one hundred percent happy that I came to Russia and will definitely be back!,
6565,- Speaking of culture and traditions - how do you like Russian cuisine?,
6566,-,
6567,"When I come to another country, I normally don’t eat much.",
6568,I can’t say why but I want to say right away that I didn’t have any problems whatsoever with food in St. Petersburg: one definitely can find a lot of places to eat.,
6569,"And I particularly liked the dish, the name of which is very difficult for me to pronounce - pelmeni! -",
6570,And the last question: would you recommend other students to participate in such programs? -,
6571,"Absolutely! Get out of your comfort zone and set off to meet new experiences! - Andreas, thanks for the interesting interview!",
6572,"We wish you success and bright impressions!

6707,"But we didn’t regret taking a freshman, he was our idea generator.",
6708,"The night before the final was difficult, but we believed in a positive outcome and supported each other.",
6709,"There are a lot of events like this — some are run by companies, some are run by the government.",
6710,"But, in my opinion, the most interesting thing is when students create something for students, said Nexign’s representative Egor Kosarev in his closing remarks.",
6711,"When you do something for your own people, you put a lot of effort into it, you put your soul into it, you want your classmates and people from other higher educational institutions to understand that you care.",
6712,"Every year I see that the Case Championships at Polytechnic are becoming more and more large-scale, the guys are not planning to slow down, keep this tradition, be sure to participate.

6742,"The first one - after a year of study in New Zealand (Postgraduate Diploma, Level 8), the second one - after studying at Polytechnic University (Master’s degree from SPbPU).",
6743,The degrees of higher education of two different systems - Bologna and British - will significantly increase the competitiveness of future graduates on the international labor market.,
6744,The duration of education will not change.,
6745,"The International Business Development program is implemented by the Institute of Industrial Management, Economics, and Trade of SPbPU.",
6746,"“Despite the coronavirus pandemic, IIMET has made significant progress in establishing a partner network in New Zealand.",
6747,"We have formed a pool of partners with whom we continue to negotiate - particularly in the area of development international educational programs,” noted IIMET Director Vladimir SHCHEPININ.“We understand the values of New Zealand universities, the peculiarities of the education system, and the main points of prospective cooperation.",
6748,And I must say that the interest is mutual.,
6749,"In the near future, our main task is to expand the cooperation on other international programs and to intensify the joint publication activity.”",
6750,An important step in the development of the new program will be obtaining accreditation by NZQA (New Zealand Qualifications Authority).,
6751,"According to IIMET Deputy Director for International Activities Nikita LUKASHEVICH, this accreditation will allow the New Zealand partners to recognize the results of the SPbPU program and enable the graduates to get a Masters Degree, Level 9, in New Zealand.,",
6752,"According to Kiwi Education, Polytechnic University has become the first Russian university, which in 2020 has signed a cooperation agreement with a New Zealand university.",
6753,"In addition, New Zealand was the first region where SPbPU went online.",
6754,“We are glad that it was Polytechnic University that turned out to be the first university in history to sign a cooperation agreement with a university in New Zealand.,
6755,"This is not an accident, but the result of hard, patient collaboration, an understanding of the current changes in the world of higher education, and the highest professionalism on both sides,” stressed Serge NAIRI, Platinum Standard Education President and Kiwi Education Development Director.",
6756,“We are very grateful to our colleagues at Kiwi Education for the support and fruitful collaboration that began at the annual Asia Pacific Association for International Education APAIE in 2019.,

",
6760,"Darya BORODKINA, a student of the Higher School of Cyberphysical Systems and Control at ICST SPbPU, has participated in educational exchange programs since high school and studied in Finland, Lithuania, and Denmark.",
6761,"After enrolling at Polytechnic University, she also began to look for opportunities to study abroad.",
6762,She has now chosen Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (Finland) as part of the First+ program.,
6763,"Read about the preparation for the trip, the structure of the Finnish university, and the peculiarities of studying in our interview.",
6764,"- Daria, good to see you!",
6765,When did you decide that you wanted to study in Europe?,
6766,"- I started participating in exchange programs when I was in high school and I’ve been to Finland, Lithuania, and Denmark.",
6767,"True, the training there lasted only for two weeks.",
6768,"It was a very short period for me, so I had a clear desire to go to study in Europe again, but for a semester.",
6769,"- Tell us, what do you like in the system of training in Finland? -",
6770,"First of all, I like the possibility to “tune” the educational plan to my interests: here there is a wide range of various courses.",
6771,"Thus, it is possible to make a plan of work for a semester almost individually, proceeding from own desires and needs, being guided by a sight at the future profession and the competencies necessary for a career.",
6772,"I am very glad that Polytechnic University has partnership relations with foreign universities, in particular, with the Metropolitan University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, so I had the opportunity to go there to study.",
6773,- Was it difficult to prepare for the trip?,
6774,-,
6775,The most difficult stage of preparation was to pass competitive selection for the exchange program.,
6776,"Once it’s passed, everything else is a pleasant hassle.",
6777,"Yes, you need to have good enough English, but any student who is going to study in another country should be ready for that.",
6778,"It also takes a lot of time to prepare documents and get settled in the new place, but you can’t even call all this a hardship, these are rather tasks that just need to be solved to achieve the goal you set for yourself.",
6779,"- You and other students left at the beginning of January, during the pandemic.",
6780,Weren’t you scared in another country?,
6781,- I didn’t,
6782,and still don’t see any particular reason to worry about it.,
6783,"My training at Metropolia is done remotely, I have regular contacts only with my flatmates who, like me, follow all the requirements and recommendations to avoid getting infected.",
6784,"In general, my life in terms of epidemiological safety is not much different from my life in Russia: I study at home, visit stores and other establishments wearing personal protective equipment in the same way.",
6785,The rules and requirements are about the same here.,
6786,"So, no, it wasn’t scary.",
6787,"The main thing is to be conscious and try to protect yourself in every possible way, not to panic.",
6788,"I came here to study, and the coronavirus shouldn’t stop me from doing that!",
6789,"- Do you remember your first impressions when you came to a new country, to a new university?",
6790,-,
6791,My impressions of Finland are always very pleasant.,
6792,It’s very cozy and clean here.,
6793,"This winter there is still a lot of snow, snowdrifts look very picturesque, though it is quite difficult to move through them at times.",
6794,"But it was not my first time here, so I paid attention not to the beauty of the city, but to what and how I was taught.",
6795,"I felt very comfortable in Metropolia right away, because everyone and even the teachers talk very openly and friendly and the curriculum is very intensive and practice-oriented.",
6796,"True, it became a bit harder with time, because I had to process a lot of new and not always easily accessible information, but such challenges are even more inspiring.",
6797,"- Tell us a little bit about your daily life, where do you live, what are the conditions?",
6798,- It’s very comfortable!,
6799,"We live in an apartment with several girls, each has a separate room with all the amenities: bed, desk, refrigerator, closets, etc.",
6800,"Everything is done very discreetly, in the same style, the room is quite easy to adapt to your needs.",
6801,- Now let’s talk about the university itself.,
6802,What are your impressions of the university campus?,
6803,How is studying during the pandemic?,
6804,-,
6805,"In general, my impressions are the same as those of living there: clean, cozy, and beautiful.",
6806,"Although, to be honest, because of the distance learning format we hardly ever visit the campus, but for the little time that I spent there, I can say that it is really quite comfortable and pleasant.",
6807,"As for the training, it is the same as at Polytechnic University.",
6808,Even the distance learning technology and the programs and platforms used are essentially the same.,
6809,"This is quite convenient, because it was quite easy for me to rearrange.",
6810,"So we are learning in the familiar distance format: listen to lectures and attend practical classes via webinars, take online courses on the platform of distance learning, trying to absorb the material is not worse or even better than would assimilate in person.",
6811,- Is it easy to study?,
6812,"- It is not easy, and that is good.",
6813,"As I said before, there is a very rich and dense curriculum, I have to keep a lot of information in my head.",
6814,There is another difficulty: they teach me the same things that the students who have been studying here for several semesters already.,
6815,"Because of this, I need to get accustomed to and grasp the knowledge they have received in a fairly short period.",
6816,But it’s all just more motivating.,
6817,"When you can learn without effort, when you pass all tests at “A” level, with particular efforts, you inevitably lose interest in learning and, consequently, in the quality of the knowledge obtained.",
6818,"So I hope to overcome all difficulties and successfully pass this semester, it is really important for me.",
6819,"- Tell us, how do you communicate with your professors and other students?",
6820,-,
6821,The common language here is English.,
6822,"Communication with teachers is quite free, and from both sides - as we can write them questions or clarifications at any convenient time, and they sometimes write to us, when we are not waiting at all.",
6823,"Students are very open and pleasant, and this is understandable - after all, almost everyone with whom I somehow come into contact, is a participant in the exchange program, and therefore was selected and is certainly no less motivated and communicative than, for example, myself.",
6824,I got to know the students who arrived this semester and the guys who have been studying at Metropolia for more than a year.,
6825,"- What have you seen in the city, where have you been?",
6826,- We’ve been walking around Helsinki and we’ve been downtown.,
6827,"There’s definitely something to see here, but most of all I’m always amazed by modern Finnish architecture: Helsinki consists of many different buildings, each of which is beautiful in its own way, but they all fit into the single image of this cozy capital.",
6828,"- In your opinion, what is the advantage of an exchange student internship?",
6829,-,
6830,"When you get into a new environment, especially one where you can motivate yourself to work and develop, you become a better version of yourself.",
6831,"You step out of your usual boundaries, discover something new for yourself and face a lot of challenges that you have to and, most importantly, want to respond to.",
6832,An exchange study trip is a guarantee of broadening your worldview and awareness of your own place in your profession and in life.,
6833,"You can look at yourself, at your knowledge and competencies, at the learning process, and the world as a whole from a different perspective.",
6834,And then understand where to move forward and what to strive for in the future.,
6835,"Under such conditions, you discover new opportunities, develop yourself and reach new heights.",
6836,- What advice would you give to students who also plan to go to study abroad?,
6837,- Definitely don’t sit still and wait for offers.,
6838,We need to offer ourselves.,
6839,"Those who are interested in studying abroad should not put off their plans for the next month, semester, or course, but as soon as the desire is formed, look for exchange programs that Polytechnic University offers, and try!",
6840,"I generally tend to think that in life you should not miss out on promising opportunities, especially in the period of education, at a time when the formation of personality and the formation of competencies and view of the world takes place.",
6841,"So, taking the opportunity to try yourself and find out what it is like to study abroad is definitely worthwhile!",

7053,"In addition, it is a great feeling to look for Raskolnikovs house, Akaky Akakiyevichs overcoat on the bridge and famous places like them in Russian literature, or to have a drink at the last cafe where Pushkin visited before the duel., - How did you continue your studying while the coronavirus pandemic?",
7054,- I continued to stay in the dormitory of the university.,
7055,"This place provided necessary checks and was cleaned regularly, so I didn’t hesitate.",
7056,We continued with online education from here.,
7057,We got used to the system after a few lessons.,
7058,"And at some points, I liked this new system.",
7059,- How did your life change with distance learning?,
7060,- It was good to be able to listen to lecture records again and not to waste time on the way to class.,
7061,"In fact, I think that some courses should continue online when normal education will start.",
7062,"Since we lived with our friends in the dormitory, we were able to study together when necessary.",
7063,"For the questions stuck in our heads, our teachers were just one mail away.",
7064,- What would you advice to students who are planning to study abroad under the Erasmus+ program?,
7065,I recommend them to join this program without hesitation.,

7070,The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is one of the smallest states in Europe.,
7071,"It borders Belgium, Germany, and France, and its inhabitants usually speak three languages: Luxembourgian, German, and French.",
7072,"In 2003, the University of Luxembourg was founded in Luxembourg, where today students from 125 countries study.",
7073,"Anna DONTSOVA, a student of the Civil Engineering Institute of St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, also went there for the fall semester within the Erasmus+ project.",
7074,Anna spent six months studying in the «Design of unique buildings with the principles of sustainable development» program.,
7075,"She participated in individual and project work, gained many useful acquaintances, and impressed Luxembourg professors with the knowledge received at Polytechnic University.",
7076,Read about this and more in our interview.,
7077,"— Anna, is this your first trip to study abroad?",
7078,"— Yes, it was my first experience, but not my first attempt.",
7079,"When I was in my last year of undergraduate studies, I passed the competitive selection for the international double degree program with Saimaa University in Finland.",
7080,"But then, for a number of reasons, I declined to participate.",
7081,Now I even wonder how my life would have turned out if that trip had taken place.,
7082,— What was your reaction when you found out that you were going to study in Luxembourg?,
7083,"— I knew almost nothing about that country, but now I think it’s the best country.",
7084,The fact that I am learning German was of course a great advantage.,
7085,— How long were the preparations for the trip?,
7086,— About half a year.,
7087,"Luxembourg is a very small country, not very popular for tourism.",
7088,"Therefore there is not much information about it on the Internet, and in many respects I had to understand myself, in particular, to study the site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg.",
7089,"Funny thing is that I started to make a list of things for the trip a few months in advance, but still was gathering the day before departure.",
7090,"Because of the pandemic, I didn’t believe until the last week that I could go abroad to study.",
7091,— Do you remember how you felt in the first days of living in a new place?,
7092,— In the first days I felt like a robot — so thoroughly concentrated on everything.,
7093,"When I flew to Luxembourg — by the way, remember that there are no direct flights to Luxembourg — I was terribly afraid to miss first the bus and then my stop.",
7094,It seems funny only until you realize that the next stop would only be in France!,
7095,"Then I did the paperwork, registered at the commune, participated in the first day of the semester, checked into my dorm, got a bank card and SIM card, and got a coronavirus shot so I could travel freely around Europe.",
7096,"At the same time, I was euphoric about new experiences and sensations.",
7097,I loved everything that was going on around me!,
7098,— What was the hardest thing for you about adapting?,
7099,"— Even though I immediately felt in my place, I would like to talk about some points.",
7100,"For me, adaptation consisted of thinking about my every action, every word, in terms of national, cultural, and even legal features of the country.",
7101,What if what I am used to is not polite or allowed at all?,
7102,What if I might have accidentally offended someone?,
7103,"Fortunately, I did not find any particular cultural differences.",
7104,"Luxembourg is a multicultural country, and also one of the safest.",
7105,"Even at night on a dark street, you feel safe here.",
7106,— Tell us about your dormitory.,
7107,How was your life arranged?,
7108,Who were your neighbors?,
7109,— I was very lucky with the dormitory.,
7110,"In my case, it has ’s the apartment type.",
7111,"Each apartment has four rooms, bathrooms, a common kitchen-living room with all the necessary appliances.",
7112,The rooms are high-ceilinged and spacious.,
7113,My roommates were also great — two female students from Germany who were studying psychology and a student from Cameroon who was studying economics.,
7114,We often spent time together and sometimes had parties where our friends came.,
7115,— What are your impressions of the university campus?,
7116,"— The University of Luxembourg has three campuses: Belval, Kirchberg, and Limpertsberg.",
7117,The Belval campus is close to my dormitory.,
7118,"It used to be the site of steelworks, and there are many reminiscent of that.",
7119,"For example, there are cafes and offices in the former shops, and the largest shop houses the university library.",
7120,It looks very futuristic.,
7121,The campus itself is equipped for people with limited mobility.,
7122,"The buildings have elevators and escalators, the classrooms have lots of technology, and you can also write directly on the walls with markers.",
7123,"At the Belval campus, I mostly met with faculty members, and classes were held at the other campus, Kirchberg.",
7124,It is close to the European Parliament building.,
7125,The campus buildings were built in the spirit of constructivism in the 1960s and 1970s.,
7126,"Despite their age, the interior here is very modern.",
7127,"The classrooms are equipped with everything you need, there is a canteen, study areas with desks and chairs and sitting areas with armchairs and sofas.",
7128,— How did you study?,
7129,What subjects did you study?,
7130,"— At first, we studied in a mixed format, but closer to mid-November the university switched completely to full-time mode.",
7131,"In Luxembourg, I had four disciplines that were analogous to my subjects in the Polytechnic curriculum.",
7132,"For all subjects, I had to complete a project for credit, so I had a total of three group projects and one individual project.",
7133,I also studied two other subjects remotely at SPbPU: heat and mass transfer in continuous media and the basics of heat supply and ventilation.,
7134,— What did participation in the Erasmus+ project become for you?,
7135,"— At the very least, participation in Erasmus+ brought me invaluable life experience.",
7136,"I tested my strengths and abilities, learned to live in another country, cope with all the new bureaucratic procedures, understand the laws in a foreign language.",
7137,"More than ever, I realized that the only person who can get me out of all the difficulties — it’s me.",
7138,"For the first time in my life, I went on a solo vacation — after all the exams I spent a week in Portugal, Spain, and France.",
7139,The Erasmus+ project allowed me to look at my life from a different perspective — this also applies to everyday life and academic work.,
7140,"If we talk about more practical things, thanks to Erasmus+ I have made a lot of new acquaintances.",
7141,I think I was able to impress with my knowledge the professors I interacted with at the University of Luxembourg.,
7142,"At the end of the semester, I received two offers to continue my research at the university.",
7143,— What advice would you give (or not give) to students who also want to study abroad?,
7144,"— Based on my experience, I would advise students not to plan exchange trips in their junior year when they have too much of a course load.",
7145,"There is a chance that many of your subjects will have no counterparts at a foreign university, and you will have to spend a lot of time and effort to find a way to study them remotely.",
7146,It is a very serious workload.,
7147,"At the same time, I would like to say that no matter how scared you are of taking a step into the unknown, do it.",
7148,"Apply, apply, get involved in any student movement that you can, because studentship ends quickly.",
7149,"But at the same time, look at the world without rose-colored glasses.",
7150,"Be prudent: check your documents, double-check everything, think through your options in advance in case of emergencies.

7172,- What can you say about the instructors who taught the machine learning course at the summer school?,
7173,- They are great specialists!,

7313,- Can you give examples of professions that students will be able to master in the future?,
7314,-,
7315,"The range is quite large – it’s an analyst, interface developer, control system developer, intelligent control system developer.",
7316,"In other words, these are practically all professions that will oversee production processes.",
7317,- Are you planning any changes for programs in future seasons?,
7318,"- We don’t stand still, and we incorporate innovations into our programs as they become available.",
7319,Here’s an example from the field of programming languages.,
7320,"In the middle of last year, a new standard appeared.",
7321,This had an immediate impact on the content of our courses - we made changes to both our software products and the teaching process.,
7322,"In addition, every year, students work on new projects - we choose them according to current trends.",
7323,- Thank you for the interesting interview!,
7324,"We wish you successful programs and motivated students!
",
7325,"Last week, graduates of the Intelligent Systems International program were receiving congratulations.",
7326,11,
7327,"Master’s degree holders from Russia, Germany, Mexico and India successfully defended their graduation theses.",
7328,"On this occasion, they all gathered in the hall of the SPbPU Academic Council, where the Rector of SPbPU, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Andrei RUDSKOI addressed the students with words of farewell and wishes of new victories and achievements.",
7329,“I am very pleased that your training in the international Masters degree program took place jointly with Leibniz University of Hanover.,
7330,We have been cooperating with this university for about 50 years.,
7331,You studied at the scientific schools of two outstanding universities and now you are the carriers of unique knowledge that no one except you and your predecessors has.,
7332,"I am sure that this will help you in finding jobs and that all of you will find a worthy application for your knowledge,” said the rector of SPbPU.",
7333,", The path that the graduate students took was far from easy.",
7334,"For a year, they studied at Polytechnic University, and then they spent another year studying at Leibniz University of Hanover (LUG; Germany).",
7335,"Serious research and practical training took place at both universities: the guys conducted research and participated in experiments at the laboratories and centers of Polytechnic University, worked on joint projects at Leibniz University of Hanover and customer enterprises in Germany, published joint articles.",
7336,"Since the group brought together students from different regions and states, who studied for two years in two countries, their language of instruction and communication was English.",
7337,"“For future IT professionals, this is a significant competitive advantage and significant time saving: English has firmly established its reputation as a computer technology language, and training in international groups in English allows students to master the best practices and get the newest information from the field of computer science,” explained the director of the Higher School of Cyberphysical Systems and Management Vyacheslav SHKODYREV.",
7338,It is important to note that the top level of training in the Intelligent Systems Program was repeatedly noted by competent experts and confirmed by a wide selection of places for graduates’ employment.,
7339,Let us remind that the Intelligent Systems International Program gives students the opportunity to get two degrees at once: from Polytechnic University and the partner university.,
7340,"Therefore, despite the successful defense of the final qualification works in Russia, the Master’s degree students do not relax and prepare for a trip to Leibniz University of Hanover, where they will also present the results of their projects.",
7341,"We wish them good luck and more successes in life: as the winged Latin phrase says, a journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.
",
7342,"The defense of Bachelor’s degree theses of the first graduation group of the Higher School of Creative Industry & Design of the SPbPU Institute of Machinery, Materials, and Transport (HSCI&D IMM&T) was held in a remote format.",
7343,"For the first time, the defense of graduation theses in the Industrial Design area got an international status: along with our students, students from the Peoples Republic of China presented their projects to the State Examination Commission.",
7344,", It should be noted that this was the first Bachelor’s degree graduation team in the field of “Industrial Design” released under the cooperation agreement between SPbPU and Jiangsu University.",
7345,"Teachers of the HSCI&D have repeatedly visited their colleagues in China, participated in training and qualifying exams for Chinese students.",
7346,"With the transfer to online mode of study, little has changed, except for the environment in which the defense took place: instead of presenting their works in an auditorium, students met with the SEC at Microsoft Teams, which made it possible to present his work even to a student who is now in Wuhan.",
7347,"Of the nine design projects submitted by Chinese students, eight received an “excellent” mark.",
7348,Most graduate theses are socially oriented.,
7349,"This includes the project of the home sports simulator by student Hua Zhenyang (supervisor: Associate Professor Yu.A. Aksarin), and the design project of the child transforming chair by student Liu Yingzheng (supervisor: Associate Professor A.G. Zubov).",
7350,"The most interesting project, according to the members of the SEC, was the thesis of student Shen Jiyang named “Crutches for people with limited mobility”, carried out under the scientific supervision of Associate Professor A.A. Aslyamov.",
7351,"Student A.S. Kochkina devoted her thesis to an original solution to the transport problem of SPbPU students, teachers and employees: “Design project of automatic station for renting kick scooters” (supervisor: Associate Professor A.G. Zubov).",
7352,The work of students and supervisors of graduate project was intense but motivating.,
7353,"Despite all the difficulties of recent times, international cooperation is developing; enriched with new ideas and technologies, it moves to a new level.",
7354,"After the removal of quarantine measures, it is planned to hold an exhibition of diploma projects at Jiangsu University, as yet another confirmation of the high quality of education at our university.
",
7355,"On May 4, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University launched an educational forum for students Phygital Universe - a platform for learning about the profession and communicating with industry representatives.",
7356,"The forum reflects the best aspects of the digital world, offering participants hard skills (professional skills), soft skills (interdisciplinary skills), and phygital skills (communication skills).",
7357,"Elena RAZINKINA, Vice-Rector for Educational Activities of SPbPU, emphasized: “Today there are more than 200 master’s degree programs at Polytechnic University.",
7358,"All of them meet the current trends in education, providing students with the most important competencies of a modern specialist.",
7359,"Our master’s degree programs are focused on the main customers, industrial partners of Polytechnic University, and this is reflected in the program of Phygital Universe educational forum, where participants will get acquainted not only with our university but also with well-known companies - during classes and excursions.”",
7360,"During the forum, which will last until May 7, the students will visit Baltic Industrial Company, Sew-Eurodrive, and other companies, while the participants of the hospitality track will go on an educational tour of Sokos Hotel Palace Bridge.",
7361,"Also, experts will address the students at Polytechnic University.",
7362,"Thus, within the framework of the Mechanical Engineering track there will be a master class entitled “Modern High-Performance CNC Equipment,” and for the participants of the Technical Systems Management track a meeting with a representative of the high-tech company Festo in Russia will be organized.",
7363,"In addition to the main educational program in a face-to-face format, the online program, filled with speeches by guest speakers on career, success, teamwork, innovation, etc., started on April 20.Full immersion in the educational environment and work on the tasks of the organizers is impossible without constant interaction and extracurricular component: the theme of digital has set the direction, so students will make a unique VR excursion around engineering St. Petersburg, as well as become participants in the event in a unique space - the KOD Center of moving in time.

",
7410,"Polytechnic University in conjunction with Toyota goes on with the implementation of educational project “Time to grow”, which has no analogues in Russia.",
7411,"The university and the largest automobile corporation have teamed up so that students receive not only theoretical knowledge, but also skills in modern manufacturing.",
7412,"After test assignments and interviews, nine lucky ones were selected for an internship at Toyota Motor Plant in St. Petersburg.",
7413,"Altogether, 300 Polytechnic students studied under the program.",
7414,Senior Vice President of Toyota Motor Europe Katsutoshi NISIMOTO introduced the young people to the Japanese philosophy of continuous production improvement called kaizen.,
7415,"Not only he talked about the quality standards of the company, but also spoke about his more than 30 years of experience.",
7416,The final stage of the theoretical part was a test: students who passed it received a certificate of additional education.,
7417,"Then, on a competitive basis, 20 students were selected who were given the opportunity to visit the Toyota plant and have an interview there.",
7418,"According to its results, nine Polytechnic students were invited to a production internship.",
7419,Among them were Alexei TALANIN and Bogdan ABRAMOV.,
7420,The internship began in March.,
7421,"First, the students were given a full briefing and a tour of the production, after which they were assigned to different workshops.",
7422,"Bogdan was admitted to the assembly shop, and his first task was to analyze one of the stations of the final line, where the last stage of the car assembly is carried out.",
7423,"Aleksey TALANIN, on the other hand, got into the welding workshop and was engaged in optimization of logistics processes there.",
7424,"Students and engineers even teamed up to offer solutions for optimizing various stations in the workshops, but a pandemic intervened in the design work.",
7425,"Young people hope that when the situation stabilizes and the plant starts working at its full capacity, they will be able to return to their projects.
",
7426,Each of us has more or less experience in the gaming industry.,
7427,"But some limit themselves to passing through quests and strategies, while others begin to create game characters and get fully immersed in game content.",
7428,"That’s what students have tried to do at the International Polytechnic Summer School, which this year, for the first time, included a course on game-design.",
7429,"Within two weeks, they took a long way from working on a character to placing it in the game engine.",
7430,"Semyon SHCHUR, a course teacher, associate professor of the Higher School of Creative Industry and Design (SPbPU HSCI & D), spoke about it in more detail.",
7431,"- Mr. Shchur, could you tell us where the idea of creating the game-design module came from?",
7432,-,
7433,"This idea comes from our Higher School, which produces industrial, graphic, environmental and information designers.",
7434,"It’s always interesting not just to come up with and design something, but to give it movement.",
7435,"Creating a character, working on animation is quite a complex process.",
7436,"During the course, we only touched the foundations of it.",
7437,- Who took part in the course?,
7438,- Our students can be conditionally divided into several categories.,
7439,"The first group consisted of those who wanted to learn how to develop characters, create 3D models in actual programs, animate them and place them in the game engine.",
7440,The second group comprised students who draw or model characters but are not able to animate them.,
7441,"And there is also the third group of those who are familiar with all these processes, but do not know how to connect them to each other.",
7442,"During the training, we worked in detail with every student.",
7443,"- We know that there are several types of game-design: world design, content design, interface design, and so on.",
7444,"Did the students choose a particular type of game play design, or did they dedicate the course in a single line?",
7445,-,
7446,In our module all interests revolve around creating a character.,
7447,"The character is an extension of the player, something that each of us associates with taking part in this or that game.",
7448,"However, playing and inventing a game are two completely different processes.",
7449,"When you get involved in the creation process, you realize that it becomes extremely interesting to invent a character, location, game world or assets (the components presenting graphics, sound or scripts).",
7450,- Can you share with us examples of students’ work?,
7451,-,
7452,"For example, a student from China created a character he named Sleepwalker.",
7453,"According to the author’s idea, the character should wander in a dream around a large house and look for food.",
7454,"I emphasize that students developed their heroes from scratch: first we discussed ideas, plots, images, which were then created in virtual reality.",
7455,- What is the most common starting point for a game designer?,
7456,"- In our case, the action begins with determining the scope of work, getting to know the design topic and searching for analogues that exist.",
7457,"Then, based on the collected material, the concept art is created, which determines the further development of events in the framework of character design.",
7458,- Is the profession of a game designer in demand today?,
7459,"- Our module allows to get basic skills in modeling, working with a model and its animation.",
7460,"These skills, of course, must be mastered by a person who wants to work in the field of game design.",
7461,"The level of development of multimedia technologies, the appearance on the market of services for the development of objects of virtual, augmented reality, etc. suggests that the market needs people with these skills.",
7462,- Thank you so much for the interesting interview!,
7463,"We wish your course successful development!
",
7464,How to switch to distance learning if students and teachers are in different parts of the world?,
7465,Polytechnic University’s international services found the answer.,
7466,"The example of one of the oldest international programs that our university implements together with the American Institute for Foreign Studies (AIFS) showed: if you really want it, then everything is possible.",
7467,"It so happened that in March, American universities cancelled the internships of their students at foreign universities by the decision of the US government.",
7468,"At that time, working in the joint program of SPbPU and AIFS, where 10 students were studying in three groups, was suspended.",
7469,"An immediate transition to distance learning was a must: it was necessary to transfer the Russian language, history, political science and literature courses into a new format.",
7470,"To facilitate the distance learning process, the Higher School of International Educational Programs, on the basis of which the program has been implemented, provided students with all the necessary educational materials, including textbooks that students usually take at the library.",
7471,All additional materials are sent by email or using the Google Classroom platform.,
7472,Distance classes are conducted using Skype and Zoom services.,
7473,“Students are very responsible for studying in such a new for everyone format; they are always present at online lessons and complete and send homework on time.,
7474,"I would also like to thank our teachers for their understanding, responsible and creative approach to business, despite all the difficulties that occur.",
7475,I wish you health and success!” wished the academic director of the SPbPU and AIFS network program Anna SHALYGINA.,
7476,"Foreign students also did not stand aside, and shared their impressions of the past changes with us.",
7477,"“Distance learning can help alleviate some stress by allowing students to move at their own pace, be able to rewind lectures, etc.",
7478,"My life changed in a bad way seeing as I was happy to be in Russia but then we all had to come back to the USA, and go straight into quarantine.",
7479,I’m super happy we are still doing classes but I’m sad we cannot be in Russia.,
7480,"I think the classes, even though they are distance classes, are still just as helpful/meaningful as they would be if we were there in person.",
7481,"Other than that, my life is the same as it would be.",
7482,"I would say that even though this really sucks right now, we will all get through this together.",
7483,There is solace in knowing that all of the world is suffering through this together.,
7484,"Stay safe and wash your hands!” said Caitlin HOFFMAN, student.",
7485,"“I think the current situation at my university is unfortunate, but the university is handling it very well.",
7486,They have made the transition to online classes very easy and smooth.,
7487,"Advantages in distance learning include a flexible schedule, and more online resources.",
7488,"A flexible schedule is included, because I am able to zoom call my professors at different times during the week, email them if I need help, and do work on my own time.",
7489,"We have more resources online, because we are able to have access to the Internet.",
7490,"My life changed, because I am no longer learning the Russian language in Russia.",
7491,"I am learning it from the desk in my bedroom, but I am still being given the same quality education.",
7492,Distance learning works with good communication.,
7493,I have video chat with my professors multiple times a week.,
7494,They give me resources to use on my laptop at home and they send me assignments on google classroom.,
7495,"I would like for everyone to know that even though everything is very hard right now, we will persevere.",
7496,This time has given a chance to stop and reflect.,
7497,It has given us a chance to spend time with our family and at home.,
7498,It has allowed us to appreciate little things that we didn’t before.,
7499,"Perhaps after this, we will come out as better people,” student Laurel TOLLISON shared.
",
7500,International student project marathons are a new phenomenon not only in Russia but also abroad.,
7501,"Their goal is to unite young scientists from different countries, develop student exchanges and receive new research results.",
7502,"Together with the Technology University of Graz (TU Graz, Austria), Polytechnic University is implementing 6 projects as part of the international student marathon.",
7503,Russian and foreign experts - professors and young scientists - supervise the student groups.,
7504,Why is a student project marathon a step out from a comfort zone?,
7505,What prospects await their participants in the future?,
7506,What is the uniqueness of such projects?,
7507,"Professors of the Technical University of Graz Norbert ENZINGER and Sergio AMANCIO, who are the curators of the student welding project marathon from Austria, spoke about this and not only with the SPbPU International Services.",
7508,"- Norbert, Sergio, tell us please, have you participated in student project marathons before?",
7509,Norbert:,
7510,"The international student marathon is a new experience not only for students, but also for us, professors.",
7511,We have never practiced anything like this with other universities.,
7512,Sergio:,
7513,This is new and exciting for all of us.,
7514,"We discussed the topic for the marathon last winter; as a result, we chose an area that is attractive and relevant for both universities.",
7515,- Why students participate in the marathon?,
7516,Sergio:,
7517,There is a number of advantages.,
7518,Students learn to interact with each other in the same project as a team.,
7519,They communicate with world-class specialists.,
7520,This is a unique opportunity to see how work is going on in other laboratories.,
7521,"And, of course, the cultural component: students get acquainted with another country, see the similarities and differences of other cultures.",
7522,Norbert: Not all students have the opportunity to work in laboratory every day.,
7523,"And if after graduation they want to continue to develop in the scientific area, the project marathon will be an ideal opportunity to plunge into the world of science and research.",
7524,I established some scientific contacts during visits to other laboratories.,
7525,"I do not know what these people will do later, and I do not know how our students will develop.",
7526,"But it is likely that after many years they will meet again - for example, as academic partners.",
7527,And it would be great if by then they would have such a common story.,
7528,- What language do you speak in the framework of the marathon?,
7529,Sergio: Our common language is English.,
7530,"For some students, a project marathon is also an opportunity to improve their language skills.",
7531,Norbert:,
7532,"Sometimes when working with graduate students who study part of the time in Austria, we speak German.",
7533,"By the way, a lot has changed at SPbPU since my first visit: this time I often hear German at your university.",
7534,It happens that some technical aspects are easier to explain in the language of schemes or specialized terms that are understandable without knowledge of the language.,
7535,- What are you planning to achieve as part of the project marathon?,
7536,Norbert:,
7537,Several groups of students work within the frame of this marathon.,
7538,One group is studying laser welding of metals - it is led by Olga KLIMOVA-KORSMIK.,
7539,"The group, which we supervise from the TU Graz side and Anton NAUMOV, leading researcher at the Laboratory of Light Materials and Structures, from the Polytechnic University part, are studying friction stir welding.",
7540,Our main goal is to provide students with basic knowledge of these technologies and the skills necessary to understand the basics of materials science.,
7541,"In the future, perhaps, we will prepare several joint publications.",
7542,"Sergio: Polytechnic University has equipment for friction stir welding, which we do not have at TU Graz.",
7543,It is unique.,
7544,"We will try to compare the results of working on it with our technologies, and, perhaps, based on the results obtained, we will make joint publications.",
7545,-,
7546,And what students must come up with?,
7547,Norbert: the marathon involves students of different levels of training - both graduate and postgraduate students.,
7548,"We do not expect any breakthrough results, since the project marathon is primarily a learning process.",
7549,The minimum goal is to prepare a progress report and a presentation.,
7550,Students will do all this at the last stage of the marathon.,
7551,Sergio:,
7552,Students conduct welding experiments.,
7553,"We are expecting them to come to TU Graz soon, where they will also conduct a series of experiments.",
7554,"After that, they will prepare reports and a final presentation.",
7555,They will have a month to do this.,
7556,"At the very end of the project, the team will return to Russia and present its results there.",
7557,- How did you choose participants for the marathon?,
7558,Norbert:,
7559,We looked at such qualities as hard work and dedication.,
7560,All project participants are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.,
7561,Sergio:,
7562,"Perhaps, thanks to such dedication, the team will do more than just a report and presentation.",
7563,And then its result will be the starting point for another large-scale project.,
7564,- How do you manage your project team?,
7565,Norbert:,
7566,"We share our experience, suggest what materials students can use in their work, what literature they can additionally study.",
7567,"We don’t say, “You must do precisely this and that”, but offer to make decisions on their own.",
7568,"It is very important to give students freedom, but also support.",
7569,"We are the first to read their notes for reports and presentations, provide feedback.",
7570,Sergio:,
7571,Giving students freedom does not mean leaving them alone.,
7572,It means leaving the door open.,
7573,"If they have questions, they can always contact us.",
7574,- That’s a wise approach!,
7575,How long have you been teaching?,
7576,"Norbert: I’ve been teaching for about 20 years, including about 12 as professor.",
7577,I first started working in the laboratory when I was a student.,
7578,The understanding that this was my calling came pretty soon.,
7579,"I did not work in industry for long, and returned to the university, where I continued to study in postgraduate school.",
7580,"It so happened that I started working with students, helping them, giving advice and small tasks.",
7581,"Over time, I realized that I like to share skills and knowledge with students.",
7582,Then I realized that one day I would become a professor.,
7583,Sergio: I have been teaching for almost 10 years.,
7584,I always loved difficult tasks.,
7585,"When I was a student, I had a teacher who was in close contact with the industry and solved many technical problems.",
7586,It was he who “infected” me with this trend.,
7587,At first he delegated small tasks to me.,
7588,"Over time, my experience grew, I became curator of other students, and thus grew up to my present position.",
7589,"I still love to solve the tasks set by industry partners, share experiences with students, teach and guide them, and interact with industrial and academic colleagues.",
7590,"- Colleagues, thank you for the interesting interview!",

7598,- I came to Russia 5 years ago from Uzbekistan.,
7599,"I was subconsciously sure that I would enter a university in St. Petersburg, although until the very late I did not know the results of my exams.",
7600,Moscow seemed to me a big and uncomfortable city with too many people.,
7601,"On the other hand, I didn’t want to go to a smaller city, because I am from the capital city.",
7602,"By the way, my friends from Russia at first were surprised when they learned that we have a subway in Tashkent.",
7603,Many even want to come and check it out in person.,
7604,- Did you want to study at a particular university?,
7605,By what criteria did you choose a university?,
7606,- I was considering various specialities.,

7636,Is everything fine?,
7637,-,
7638,"Yes, I live in one of the SPbPU dormitories.",
7639,"For four years I lived in the same room, and on the fifth I moved to another.",
7640,"I am sure that I will miss the dormitory, although at first I had to get used to a lot of things.",
7641,It is interesting to live here - you are surrounded by people of different cultures and nationalities.,
7642,"It’s great when you come home, and you are always met by someone, you do not feel lonely and sad.",
7643,During the pandemic we were closed for two weeks.,
7644,Friends and classmates came to my house under the windows and we communicated like this.,
7645,"They brought us food and passed it in plastic bags either through the security on which the room number was indicated, or through the window on a rope.",
7646,- What’s your impression of the teachers?,
7647,-,
7648,The teachers are true professionals.,

7661,"My program is in Russian, but our institute also has several other international educational programs.",
7662,Some of our teachers also give lectures at international programs.,
7663,"The study is interesting: once we had a seminar on numerical methods, and we observed the distribution of energy inside a small button phone.",
7664,"Once we participated in modeling emergency situations, for example, we had to check the strength of a building if a large object crashes into it.",
7665,- Do you have many practical classes?,
7666,What do you do on them?,
7667,- We have equal amounts of theory and practical classes.,
7668,It was pretty tough during the distance learning without the possibility of practicing in laboratories.,
7669,"Mostly we work in programs, on laboratory installations.",
7670,"For example, we created a thermal diagram of a thermal power plant: these are several connected power units.",
7671,"We also work in a special INSIS program, solve equations numerically, and find the distribution of pressure, temperature and other parameters inside the units.",
7672,I like it all very much.,
7673,- How do you plan to apply the knowledge gained in the future?,
7674,Are you thinking of working in your profession?,
7675,-,

7732,Here you get skills that will be useful to you later in life.,
7733,"They are long-term and more connected with your life, with how to achieve your goals, withstand the blows of fate, and the like.",
7734,"Let’s just say it’s more like the “old school,” the school of life.",
7735,"There is a saying that if you can adapt to life in Russia, then you can live anywhere in the world.",
7736,"For example, if we consider Korea, China or other Asian countries, then they are good for entrepreneurs or capitalists, while Russia is more aboutlife.",
7737,"The problematic part of the Russian education system, in my opinion, is that it is more difficult for foreigners to get a job here.",
7738,"But at the same time, it’s absolutely great here, I have the opportunity to meet many people, learn other cultures and languages.",
7739,- Why is it worth participating in the Open Doors Olympiad?,

8773,Somar Berro came to Russia from Syria.,
8774,"At Polytechnic University, he is a postgraduate student at the Higher School of Automation and Robotics of IMM&T, where he is doing scientific work on creating a special manipulative adaptive system that is designed to help people with disabilities.",
8775,"Read about what this system is, how it works, and whether serial production is planned in the future in our interview.  ",
8776,"— Somar, where did your passion for robotics come from?",
8777,— I’ve loved robots since I was a kid.,
8778,"I enjoyed watching cartoons about robots, such as the cartoon series The Grendaiser.",
8779,"There was a robot with the same name, and I thought, one day I’ll create my own Grendaiser.",
8780,"Then there was school, university, and after the bachelor’s degree I decided that robotics was my field, and I would study in that field.",
8781,— When did the desire to come to Russia arise?,
8782,— I decided to come to Russia because there is cooperation between our countries in science and education.,
8783,"Of course, it wasn’t easy at first, particularly because of the language barrier.",
8784,"But it so happened that I learned Russian fairly quickly, and it became easier.",
8785,"We have good relations with our colleagues, we are working on an interesting project.",
8786,— Can you tell us what kind of project it is?,
8787,— It is the development of a manipulative rehabilitation system; my work is coordinated by my supervisor — Professor Andrey Timofeyev.,
8788,"In the future, the system will help people who have lost their upper limbs not to give up work involving fine motor skills, but to continue their activities.",
8789,— Can you give an example of such work?,
8790,"— For example, a person making jewelry or painting.",
8791,"That is, he was doing work that required precise and fine movements.",
8792,"And then suddenly, for some reason, he lost his brush.",
8793,"Our device will help him to reproduce the necessary movements, whether painting or soldering a microchip.  ",
8794,— Would you say you’re in the business of designing a prosthesis?,
8795,— Not really.,
8796,Our device can either be built into a special prosthesis or it can be attached to an existing prosthesis.,
8797,It consists of a micromanipulator and an adaptive support.,
8798,The micromanipulator is controlled by sensors that measure the pressure of the residual limb on the residual limb socket of the prosthesis.,
8799,"To help everyone understand, the residual limb is the part of the limb that remains after amputation.",
8800,"And the residual limb socket, or residual limb socket, is the part of the prosthesis that connects the limb and the prosthesis.",
8801,— And what is the adaptive support for?,
8802,And how does the system work?,
8803,— The adaptive support is needed to fix the prosthesis in a position that is comfortable for the person.,
8804,"For example, to place it on a table or any other surface.",
8805,Let’s imagine that a technician needs to install a miniature screw in a watch.,
8806,"To do this, he places the required screwdriver on the manipulator.",
8807,The magnetized sting of the screwdriver picks up the miniature screw.,
8808,"The master utters a voice command, the adaptive support is lowered onto the table and fixes the prosthesis in a comfortable position for operation.",
8809,The person controls the micromanipulator by pushing on the stump receiver.,
8810,The error with which the micromanipulator moves the screwdriver tip is less than 0.1 mm.,
8811,You could say the error is minimal.,
8812,"In order to turn on the screwdriver, you need to say the voice command again.",
8813,This is how the micromanipulator will insert the screw into the threaded hole and tighten it.,
8814,— Are you thinking about putting your invention into mass production?,
8815,"— Currently, we have developed and researched the design of a prosthesis with an integrated micromanipulator and adaptive support.",
8816,We have also received a patent for a sample prosthetic hand.,
8817,"In the near future, we plan to obtain several more patents on this subject.",
8818,"But it’s still a long way from practical implementation, although, of course, we’d like people to be able to use our system.",
8819,"— Somar, what are your plans for the future?",
8820,"— After my Ph.D., I would like to return home to Syria to contribute to the development of the robotics sector in the country.

9485,"We should seek help from philosophers and sociologists, says Mehdi Fardmanesh, professor at Sharif University of Technology in Iran, discussing the rapid development of technology.",
9486,"An expert in the field of electronics and bioelectronics, the founder of a number of scientific laboratories, the creator of many courses in various fields, Professor Fardmanesh calls science an art, believes that doubts contribute to the evolution of knowledge and that online education will never replace classroom studies.",
9487,This is not the first year Mehdi Fardmanesh has come to Polytechnic University where he lectures students of the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications.,
9488,"In an interview with the international Office of SPbPU, the Iranian professor spoke about breakthroughs in the world of electronics, presented a formula reflecting the essence of science and gave useful advice to students.",
9489,"— Professor Fardmanesh, you are a serious technology expert.",
9490,How do you feel about online learning?,
9491,"— Everyone talks about the benefits of online learning, but I am more inclined towards the traditional format.",
9492,"For me, teaching in a classroom and live communication make a lot of sense.",
9493,It’s the only way to sense when the students’ focus is shifting and prevent the moment they lose the thread of conversation.,
9494,"While online classes make our lives easier, an important part of the learning process is lost with them.",
9495,"— In your opinion, is the engagement of today’s students in the classroom changing?",
9496,"— Let me put it this way: as a professor, I think we don’t always do a good job.",
9497,Many of us become overly immersed in teaching the basics.,
9498,"Students become overloaded with theory and their ability to see, to predict the future diminishes.",
9499,And that’s key to learning.,
9500,— But it’s kind of inevitable — there’s more and more information every year... —,
9501,"Yes, and I’m sure everyone has to work harder and harder as time goes on.",
9502,There’s already a lot more to learn now — compared to 50 years ago.,
9503,Time will tell how we will cope with the increasing flow of information.,
9504,"Perhaps — this is so far out of the realm of science fiction — scientists will use chips to store data, which will be implanted in the human brain.",
9505,"Imagine being able to download all known material about physical phenomena, and use it as needed.",
9506,But the questions immediately arise — is it ethical?,
9507,Is it humane?,
9508,And what happens if a virus gets on the chip?,
9509,"Talking about this opens up the very interesting world of bioelectronics, a field that combines biotechnology and electronics.",
9510,"I can assume that in the future, bioelectronics and biosensors will take their place in the market and have a serious chance to radically change the field of medicine.",
9511,It will be a big breakthrough in many areas.,
9512,— What other breakthroughs in electronics do you consider the most significant?,
9513,— There have been quite a few.,
9514,"The discovery of electromagnetism, the creation of the first computers, the invention of the transistor, lithium-ion batteries, liquid crystal screens; the introduction of Wi-Fi — you could go on and on about the milestones in the history of electronics that have had a major impact on our lives.",
9515,"Quantum computers — today they no longer seem like something futuristic, and there was a time when we could only read about them in science fiction novels.",
9516,Artificial Intelligence is also changing dramatically.,
9517,I’m excited to see what the world will be like in a few decades — I’m sure there will be a lot of changes.,
9518,"— You once compared science with art, why?",
9519,"— On the board in my laboratory there is a formula: (ART)2K, which can be defined as Advanced Applied Research Require Thorough True Knowledge.",
9520,This is the key for knowledge.,
9521,I believe that science really get into this.,
9522,You gain a feeling of what you do.,
9523,It’s a kind of art.,
9524,Sometimes the solutions that we have problems are very artistic and you have to use your intuition to find them.,
9525,"At the same time, you have to have the necessary knowledge — as complete as possible.",
9526,"If they are not correct, you will not get the result.",
9527,"Of course, it has nothing to do with a mathematical formula, but in my opinion it is an accurate definition of science.",
9528,"— This brings to mind the catchphrase: «The more I know, the more I realize that I know nothing».",
9529,— And it’s true!,
9530,"Imagine that there is a big board, infinite in all directions.",
9531,It is a board of knowledge.,
9532,"On it, what we know is surrounded by boundaries.",
9533,"We know what is inside the boundaries, but we have no idea where the boundaries of the board itself are.",
9534,"As you expand your knowledge, your own boundaries get bigger.",
9535,And you see that the scope of what you don’t know also increases.,
9536,"Unfortunately, our capacity, particularly our memory, is severely limited.",
9537,"Who knows, maybe someday we’ll solve this problem too!",
9538,— How dependent is man on technology today?,
9539,"— My brother, a professor at a university in Pennsylvania, USA, says that we scientists are ruining the world.",
9540,He believes that technology has taken over our lives.,
9541,And he has a point: go for a walk in the park one day and see how many people are walking around with their smartphones on.,
9542,Our brains just don’t have time to rest.,
9543,"We take the phone to the bathroom, we flip through the news feed before going to bed, we start the morning with the phone in our hand.",
9544,It seems to me that man and high technology should be disconnected as soon as possible — or at least a balance should be found.,
9545,"Perhaps experts from other fields — philosophers, psychologists, sociologists — can help us in this.",
9546,"— And of yourself, would you say that you are addicted to technology?",
9547,"— Oh, I have a different kind of addiction.",
9548,I have an endless thirst for knowledge and periodically forget that time passes.,
9549,"When I work on an experiment, create a system, delve into the phenomenon of something, I enjoy these processes.",
9550,It’s a real art.,
9551,"I enjoy being able to pass on my knowledge, to teach someone.",
9552,"The true pleasure is to see the gleam in the eyes of students, the real emotions.",
9553,It is impossible to feel them in online learning — so once again I will talk about the benefits and advantages of traditional classes.,
9554,"Of course, I’m a workaholic, and I love it.",
9555,I love teaching and seeing students learn.,
9556,When they see with their own eyes how a project is launched.,
9557,The magic that comes on from the results achieved probably happens to everyone.,
9558,I once had a group that was behind on a lab work deadline.,
9559,"They started late at night, and, of course, they didn’t make the deadline.",
9560,"Then they asked me to help, and we started working together.",
9561,"You should have seen it — when they realized that the project was working, and they could personally see the results of their work, they were so happy that they turned on the music and started jumping almost to the ceiling.",
9562,Then someone looked at the clock — it was half past two in the morning.,
9563,"After a while, they gave me the night owl award.",
9564,Very symbolic!,
9565,— Is the teaching process at SPbPU much different from other universities?,
9566,— I would say that the teaching style at Polytechnic University is a little different from what I’m used to.,
9567,But students adapt very quickly.,
9568,I think the fact that the lectures are in English is very useful for them.,
9569,"My lectures are very interactive, and the students interact well with me.",
9570,"Not everyone is fluent in English, but you can shake them up and say: wait, it’s not your native language!",
9571,"It’s not mine either, by the way.",
9572,"I also make mistakes, but I am a scientist-engineer, who first of all cares about the result.",
9573,"— What three important qualities, in your opinion, should a student or a young scientist have in order to succeed?",
9574,— The first is to be a broad-minded person with no preconceptions.,
9575,Have the ability to explore and observe.,
9576,The second is to study scientific concepts carefully to avoid superficial knowledge.,
9577,"And third, never assume that you really know a subject.",
9578,Facts you are completely sure of today may be false tomorrow.,
9579,I would put it this way: always doubt what you know and what you believe.,
9580,We don’t know how much we don’t know.,
9581,And how can I be sure of what I don’t know?,
9582,Confidence stops us from growing.,
9583,Why learn something when you already know everything?,
9584,"But when you doubt, your knowledge evolves and improves.",
9585,"So don’t be afraid to doubt!

10074,"In 2018, the Adapters PI team launched a new project: Student Buddy Program Enjoy Polytech, where each participant can become a tutor for an international student.",
10075,"Tutors in this project are called “buddies;” a buddy meets an international student at the airport, helps with the dormitory check-in and gathering all necessary for enrollment documents, introduces to the city and helps to blend in the university life.",
10076,"To participate in this project, each international student should fill in an online form.",

10089,"They learn special features of team building, communication, conflict management, history and structure of the Polytechnic student associations, work in groups, participate in training courses and implement various projects.",
10090,"Buddies undergo additional training; they learn specifics of communication with people from other cultures, learn to work with documents, etc. Adapters’ work lasts through the whole year: starting in September, members of the Public Institute will become curators and tutors for the freshmen.",
10091,"They will help the newcomers to find common language with each other, organize a series of informal meetings and events, keep telling them about various student and university events.",
10092,"Traditionally, two adapters are assigned to each group of freshmen; they create a mutual discussion in the messenger and thus can always stay in touch with their group.",

10162,They told me that in Europe parts are more complicated and incomprehensible.,
10163,"Whereas we need specific, simple and competitive parts.",
10164,Their quality is often better than European ones.,
10165,I like this kind of practical approach.,
10166,— You won the Student of the Year contest.,
10167,Did you have any premonition of winning?,
10168,"— Pavel Nedelko, Assistant Vice Rector for International Affairs at SPbPU, recommended me to take part in this competition.",
10169,"From my first days at Polytechnic University, he became my mentor.",
10170,"At first I didn’t want to register, and I didn’t expect to be a winner until the very last.",
10171,But my portfolio made a big impression on the jury.,
10172,I was the first student from Indonesia to win the competition.,
10173,I even had a big interview for the Indonesian media.,
10174,— How do you find a balance between academic and social activities?,
10175,"— If you expect me to answer that it’s easy, it’s not.",
10176,It was very difficult for me to find that balance.,
10177,Successful people who are leaders in their fields are an example to me.,
10178,"If they succeeded, I will succeed too.",
10179,Now the trend of interdisciplinary education is gaining popularity.,
10180,Society and business need people who are able to work in several areas.,
10181,"You can do different kinds of activities and eventually choose some new idea out of that, which will be a reflection of your previous experience.",
10182,"I feel like I’m now moving where I’ve planned to go, and that it’s just getting started.",
10183,— What other events are you involved in and what events are you hosting?,
10184,"— We did Alumni Week — it was online, it was attended by ministry representatives, successful alumni who became university rectors.",
10185,We did an Indonesian language project with Russian participants.,
10186,"In Indonesia we visit schools, tell them about scholarship opportunities in Russia in different programs.",
10187,Pupils of more than 35 schools of my native province Jambi know about it.,
10188,And it is more than one thousand people.,
10189,"Last November I took part in the BRICS+ International Municipal Forum, where I spoke in the youth section.",
10190,"I talked about interdisciplinary approach, intercultural dialogue, environmental problems.",
10191,"— As far as we know, you are also involved in Polytechnic University student communities.",
10192,"— Yes, the TutorForces tutoring service, the international student club PolyUnion — these are great projects that are very useful to international students.",
10193,"I constantly communicate with undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students from Indonesia.",
10194,There is a popular phrase that Russians don’t leave each other behind.,
10195,And neither do we!,
10196,"I love challenges, and I try to show that each of us can achieve something.",
10197,— What advice would you give to other students to succeed?,
10198,— You don’t have to be afraid to try.,
10199,You don’t have to wait for opportunities.,
10200,You have to run and take it.,
10201,"Seriously, if you see an opportunity, rush for it!",
10202,"Sometimes people know there’s an opportunity, but they put it off until later.",
10203,You don’t have to put it off!,
10204,It all starts with you.,
10205,"Time is running ahead, and the most important thing is to be helpful to each other, to be supportive of each other.",
10206,That’s one of the basics.,
10207,And don’t forget to study.,
10208,"Studying is a priority.
",
10209,"Three years ago, the student eco-community ReGreen appeared within the walls of Polytechnic University.",
10210,"During this time, the guys have already managed to organize a system of separate waste collection on campus, are active in eco-education activities, and in the spring of this year will start a recycling workshop PolyCycle, in which the collected lids can be used to make souvenirs and accessories.",
10211,"As part of the Polytechnic Project grant competition, the guys from ReGreen, a student eco-community of the SPbPU trade union organization, are assembling a plastic recycling machine to make pellets that can be used in construction.",
10212,And they will also be able to produce souvenirs of the university for the benefit of the environment.,
10213,ReGreen activists plan to create a plastic waste recycling facility at Polytechnic University.,
10214,They are based on the experience of the Dutch startup Precious Plastic.,
10215,The founder of the startup made publicly available the blueprints of the recycling plants with explanatory video instructions.,
10216,"The guys used the blueprints, made some adjustments, and got to work.",
10217,"And if you, too, want to build your own plastic recycling machine when you have a spare minute, they recommend starting with this channel.",
10218,"Students assemble three units: a shredder, an injector, and a drying cabinet.",
10219,"It sounds creepy, but it’s actually pretty simple.",
10220,"The shredder shreds plastic lids into flakes, the injector allows you to melt the flakes into molds, and the drying oven is an “oven” for producing large complex items.",
10221,ReGreen is based on students from the Polytechnic Institute of Civil Engineering.,
10222,"In their activities they are very helped by the study of special construction disciplines, such as waste management and work with building materials.",
10223,And even work on equipment for the future workshop unfolded on the basis of the educational laboratory of “Building materials”.,
10224,"In addition, students have the opportunity to seek help from researchers and professors at Polytechnic University, who are very supportive of their endeavors.",
10225,The ReGreen team regularly refers to scientific research to understand the properties and capabilities of certain materials.,
10226,This is facilitated both by their own research activities in the course of their studies and by the research that the laboratory staff and instructors at the Institute do.,
10227,That’s why one of the workshop’s ideas is to produce aggregate for concrete used in construction from recycled materials.,
10228,"The guys also want to experiment with raw materials and produce related materials, such as paving tiles.",
10229,"“Now the entire building materials industry is moving to a circular economy, as the industry has a negative impact on the environment at all stages, from the extraction of raw materials to the disposal of construction waste,” explain the activists from ReGreen.",
10230,"Besides, it will be possible to make souvenirs, accessories, interior items, and even to equip the urban environment - benches, poles, art objects - from raw materials recycled in the workshop.",
10231,The future workshop is an interdisciplinary project.,
10232,"Now students from the Institute of Civil Engineering and the Institute of Physics Nanotechnology and Telecommunications are working on it, as well as graduate students from the Institute of Machinery, Materials and Transport.",
10233,"Each is responsible for his or her own profile: electronics, “iron”, work with plastic waste, etc.",
10234,"If you are close to the idea of making the world around you cleaner, you can always join the guys and make your contribution to the “green” future of the planet.",
10235,"If you are close to the idea of making the world a cleaner place, you can join the ReGreen movement We have already started collecting caps from plastic bottles and plastic bags for new souvenirs.
",
10236,"In the summer, the situation with the coronavirus improved to such degree that universities, including Polytechnic University, decided to start the new academic year in classes, observing the mask regime and other preventive measures.",
10237,"However, the coronavirus did not give up, and the incidence began to grow and in November in St. Petersburg it exceeded the May maximum by almost three times.",
10238,"Unfortunately, mortality is also on the rise.",
10239,"Therefore, Governor Alexander BEGLOV decided to reintroduce temporary restrictions in the city and turned to university rectors with a request to organize the educational process and the upcoming session in a distance format for the maximum possible number of students and postgraduates.",
10240,"SPbPU Rector Andrei RUDSKOI signed an order to introduce a special work regime for the university starting November 16.This means that students will study remotely, and teachers and staff will work on a combined schedule (combining face-to-face and remote formats) to reduce the number of people simultaneously present on the premises.",
10241,Dissertation Councils will continue to work in compliance with the prevention and safety measures provided for in the “Methodological Recommendations for Safe Operation of SPbPU in an Unfavorable Sanitary and Epidemiological Situation in the Russian Federation.”,
10242,The same requirements apply to scientific research.,
10243,Employees belonging to risk groups shall be transferred completely to the remote work format.,
10244,The holding of mass events of more than 70 people in the premises of the university is limited.,
10245,"Entrance control in educational buildings and dormitories will be made stronger, as well as control of the mask regime and the time of absence of residents in dormitories.",
10246,"University employees and students are advised to refrain from traveling outside the Russian Federation, including on academic mobility programs, and to limit travel in Russia.",
10247,"At the Military Training Center, the educational process will end on December 1.",
10248,"Nonresident students staying in dormitories of the student campus are advised to return to their permanent residences for the period of distance learning, suspending the rental agreements on a personal request (the place in the dormitory will remain reserved but no fee will be charged).",
10249,Reimbursement of travel expenses for nonresident students living in dormitories in case of their departure before December 1 (for those studying at the Military Training Center before December 5) shall be provided.,
10250,Interaction with foreign partners is completely transferred to a remote format.,
10251,"Training of foreign citizens under pre-university training programs and the study of the Russian language will be held in person, but in small groups, taking into account the possibility of their on-premises placement.",
10252,Foreign students living in dormitories will be provided with conditions for continuing their studies in a distance mode.,
10253,Students of international educational programs in engineering and technical areas are recommended to conduct practical and laboratory classes in full-time format in compliance with the “Methodological recommendations for conducting safe activities of SPbPU in an unfavorable sanitary and epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation.”,
10254,"Distance learning will run from November 16 to February 6, 2021.",
10255,"The winter session will be organized in online mode.
",
10256,It is really difficult to define a moment when students startups in the modern educational system stopped being associated with something new and unusual.,
10257,"Even more, ideas to make startup equivalent to traditional graduate thesis are discussed at government level, and as everything new they have their pros and cons.,",
10258,"Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University is on trend: the University encourages students startups, and business-ideas of young scientists are supported by Business incubator Polytechnic., During the previous academic year Polytechnic students took part in various ambitious projects: unique discussion platform Foresight Fleet 2017, final of the track TechNet - the largest start-up accelerator GenerationS in Russia and Eastern Europe, world competition for young entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, etc.",
10259,Short-term programs of SPbPU also correspond with the modern trends.,
10260,"For example, under the educational module Global Entrepreneurship: Design Thinking and Start-Ups of International Polytechnic Summer School, which took part in September, 2017, the students presented their own startups at the end of their studying.",
10261,"Arina VOLKOVA (Russia), Christophe CLARET (Germany) and Vahab HASIRI (Iran) after the end of the program shared their impressions.",
10262,They are sure: the knowledge and experience they had during the Summer school will definitely be useful for their future life.,
10263,", Arina and Christoph worked in a team where also were students from France, Italy and China On a one hand, we knew plenty useful information and learnt a lot, on the other hand, there was lots of fun, - says Christoph, - we created our tool from scratch: brainstormed everything, made researches, developed business-ideas and presented out product to the audience., Arinas and Christopshs team was thinking about daily problems.",
10264,"We came to the solution that when you are in a rush, you have a problem that if you drink coffee, or eat something you can muck your clothes.",
10265,So we invented a tool that can clean your clothes in any situation - says Arina.,
10266,",",
10267,Their team invented a portable cleaner.,
10268,"This gadget is no bigger than a smartphone, and contains both iron and cleaning substance.",
10269,"You can carry it in your bag, and it wont take much space – the inventors assure.",
10270,"The group had to do a lot: they defined a target audience (businessmen with every minute planned with precision), discussed the details with engineers (they confirmed that this product implementation was possible), planned a budget, presented ideas of market promotion of a product.",
10271,"And, of course, the students defined and analyzed the main competitors.",
10272,"A similar device exists in the real market, but the group met those portable iron with a critical eye.",
10273,You can only iron your cellar or cuffs with this gadget.,
10274,"Of course, it is better than nothing, but our tool is able to iron the whole shirt or trousers, and its price would be really low - says Arina.,",
10275,"In Vahabs team there were students from Russia, France, Germany and China.",
10276,All of the students were interested in sport.,
10277,"On a final presentation they presented a special bandage, which could protect sportsmen from injuries and even replace the necessity of doing some medical operations.",
10278,", We are seriously keen on this device, that is why I cannot describe the entire idea: we have all the chances to implement it in a real market, - says Vahab, - the diversity of cultures created amazing working atmosphere.",
10279,"I was very glad to meet people from different countries, to have a teamwork with them, to create a business project together.",
10280,"That is one of the biggest advantages of such educational programs: people learn to understand each other, respect the opinions of each other, and listen to each other.",
10281,"I am grateful to International Polytechnic Summer School for such an opportunity, and without any hesitation will recommend it to my friends and acquaintances., A combination of science and art paves the way for new creative and brave ideas, which have all the chances to be successfully implemented.",
10282,"The examples of students who had not only presented their projects, but also had proved their right to exist, show once again, that there is no harm in dreaming, but there is a lot of harm in inactivity.",
10283,"As an ancient Roman writer and scholar Pliny the Elder told: How many things, too, are looked upon as quite impossible until they have actually been effected?
",
10284,"February 19 is a special day in the history of our university: 119 years ago, by an order of S.Yu.",
10285,"WITTE, Minister of Finance of the Russian Empire, St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute was founded.",
10286,"Traditionally, this event is celebrated with a gala ball to which the best SPbPU students are invited with their companions.",
10287,"This time, more than 100 dance couples of gifted and goal-oriented girls and boys waltzed on the historical parquet of the Fundamental Library.",
10288,"According to the ceremony, the ball started with the anthem of our University followed by the record of the address of the first director of Polytechnic Institute Prince A.G. GAGARIN Prince GAGARIN had greeted the first Polytechnic students in exactly these words: In our eyes, you are the future and the hope of Russia.",
10289,"The mission of the university, which Prince Gagarin formulated 119 years ago, remains quite essential in our days.",
10290,"Starting the ball, leaders of the University warmly greeted the present generation of Polytechnic students.",
10291,Vice Rector on Research Vitaliy V. SERGEYEV addressed the students.,
10292,To be a Polytechnic alumnus is more than just getting education here; it means to become a member of a big family.,
10293,"Never mind where you happen to be, a Polytechnic alumnus would always be a dear and akin person, the Vice Rector said.",
10294,Students achievements in education and science open enormous prospects to them.,
10295,"Many of the students can already impress with personal scholarships, grants, and implemented projects.",
10296,"Right on the stage, the Vice Rector on Research awarded with diplomas and gifts the best of the best, those who had most brilliantly displayed themselves through 2017.",
10297,", For example, postgraduate student of the Department of Physics of Semiconductors and Nanoelectronics, IPN&T, Ivan Makhov, not only has he been for two years the holder of an RF President scholarship, he also is the leader of a state order grant of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.",
10298,"The young scholar is motivated by the grand and noble mission to make sure that the unique results achieved by the laboratory staff were broadly used in practice, i.e., in health care, industry, and even the security sphere Recipient of the Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences graduate student of IAMM Dmitry TRETYAKOV was also one of the university awardees.",
10299,"For three years, within the frame of an RNF grant, together with the staff of the Department of Mechanics and Control Processes he had been engaged in the researches in the sphere of ultra-sound diagnostics.",
10300,"Dmitry was in charge of the entire scope of experimental work; at 24, he is already author of 35 scholarly articles.",
10301,The Orchestra of the Peter the Great Naval College and disciples of the Polyvoks studio of academic and pop vocalism helped to create the festive atmosphere of the ball.,
10302,"Each year, the traditional ball timed with the university\s birthday gets more and more solemn and beautiful.",
10303,"To a big extent it is so thanks to the young people themselves: they dress up, young men wearing suits and young ladies in evening gowns.",
10304,"As if this all is taking us back, into the atmosphere of the 18th - 19th centuries; the most important thing is that the very event of the ball is absolutely in the spirit of St. Petersburg.",
10305,"It is so pleasant to be in the company of young, talented, smart, beautiful, and civilized young people, graduate student of IAPT Margarita MURZINA, a novice of the ball, shared her impressions.",
10306,"After a waltz and mazurka, and even the traditional thread-the-needle, the dancers moved to more advanced genres and showed their full force at the disco: the ball ended with lively dances to the most popular hits.

10325,Our management personnel is trained on the use of special disinfectants and other decease prevention actions.,
10326,"Also remember, that international students are allowed to the educational process after 14 days of isolation (since the date of entry into the Russian Federation), with a test for COVID-19 on days 10-12 by the PCR method.",

",
10334,The press-tour on the exhibition of art objects of the Termen Project took place at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.,
10335,The exposition is held in the framework of the 2nd Art Weekend Curatorial Forum and the Open Doors Day of St. Petersburg galleries and art spaces.,
10336,"Such an Open Day allows the general public to get acquainted with the modern art, take part in lectures and discussions, and visit performances, exhibitions and excursions on different city platforms.",
10337,Curatorial Forum events are organized by the North-West branch of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts with the support of St. Petersburg Foundation for Innovations.,
10338,The press-tour at Polytechnic University brought together journalists and art critics of the leading St. Petersburg and Russian media sources.,
10339,"The event began at the art-object “Eyes on a Chain” in the lobby of the Technopolis Polytech Research and Development Building with welcoming speeches by Maria KATTS, head of the North-West branch of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts; Sergey SALKUTSAN, Director General of the St. Petersburg Fund for Initiatives and Deputy Head of the Directorate of the NTI Research and Development Center, and Marianna DIAKOVA, head of the SPbPU Public Relations Department.",
10340,"“The participation of Polytechnic University in the project is not a coincidence; this year, the Curatorial Forum is actively working with university platforms to show and reveal the potential of the relationship between education, science and contemporary art,” explained S. Salkutsan.",
10341,The participants of the press-tour could feel this connection through the amazing harmony of the modern art object with the atmosphere of Technopolis - the main innovation and scientific center of the university.,
10342,The author of the art object “Eyes on a Chain” Ekaterina SOKOLOVSKAYA told about its concept and creation technology.,
10343,"The work was based on the idea of transformation of memories through bodily images and active experience of one’s own body, looking at it from the inside, from the first-person perspective.",
10344,"Then the press tour continued around the Polytechnic University campus, in the yard of the Mechanical Building and near the Hydro Tower.",
10345,"The objects of the Termen Art Project, created by artists Jan POSADSKY and Oleg SOROKO, are located at these points.",
10346,"The authors devoted their works to Lev Termen, a graduate of Polytechnic University, the creator of Thermenvox and “forefather” of electronic music.",
10347,"The art objects of the Termen Project are scattered all over the University: “Thermenvox” is in front of the Water Tower, “Tesla” is in the air duct near the Mechanical Building, and “Hands in the Hemisphere” are covering the fountain “We” near the 1st Academic Building.",
10348,"All three objects were made using AR-technology (augmented reality technologies) - to view them, journalists needed a smartphone, on the screen of which appeared augmented graphics and the thermenvox music accompaniment.
",
10349,An exception is only those maintenance services if the university life is impossible without them.,
10350,"According to the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation “On the announcement of days off in the Russian Federation” and the Order of the Minister of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, during the period of March 30 - April 5 at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University nobody is working.",
10351,Such preventive measures have been taken to stop the spread of coronavirus infection in our country.,
10352,According to the Order of SPbPU Rector of Andrei RUDSKOI the salary for this period will be fully paid.,
10353,Only employees of the units providing the university’s vital functions are supposed to work.,
10354,Students will have a vacation from March 28 to April 5.,
10355,You can take a break from distance learning and return to it after a week with renewed strength.,
10356,"The main thing is not to relax and do not forget about prevention, avoid crowded places, wash your hands, use sanitary napkins, antiseptics and, if possible, medical masks.",
10357,"It is better to stay at home or if you have to go out keep a distance with other people.
",
10358,"The academic year 2019/2020, perhaps the most unusual in the history of Polytechnic University, is coming to an end.",
10359,"Almost the entire second semester, starting from March 16, students and teachers did not attend the classrooms, classes were conducted remotely and exams were taken in the same mode.",
10360,"Of course, in the earlier history there were periods when life in Polytechnic Institute would come to a stop.",
10361,"From January 1905 to September 1906, no classes were held because of the first Russian revolution.",
10362,"Later, the Great Patriotic War interrupted regular studies.",
10363,"And now, quite a peaceful year of 2020 brought a new threat, this time from an unknown coronavirus infection that swept the world.",
10364,But the life of present-day Polytechnic University would not stop for a day.,
10365,"Competent operational management, well-developed high technology and qualified IT-specialists provided the university with the opportunity to continue educational, scientific, and social activities in online format.",
10366,"Since the unexplored disease turned out to be quite contagious, it was vital to reduce contacts among people, to cancel mass events, including classes in classrooms and laboratories.",
10367,Training was conducted remotely and students could study at home without using public transport.,
10368,The Polytechnic University administration suggested that students from outside the city should return home for this period.,
10369,But not everybody could do that; strict rules were established and preventive measures taken in dormitories for the safety of residents.,
10370,"However, it was impossible to trace every step of each person, especially when they left the dormitory.",
10371,"The nature of the new coronavirus is such that it is possible to pick it up even going out for a while, as not all Petersburgers consider it necessary to wear masks, violating the requirements of the city authorities.",
10372,"Thus, a student of the Polytechnic College, who lives in dormitory 16, was hospitalized, and 110 people who stayed s in the dormitory when his diagnosis was confirmed were quarantined.",
10373,"The university undertook to provide the students with food, water and everything they needed upon their request.",
10374,"For moral support they announced a flash mob in social networks #Polytechtogether, where everyone who wanted to support the guys posted their photos with the appropriate hash tag.",
10375,"Everything ended safely, the person got well, the observation was removed.",
10376,"But after a while, the story repeated itself in dormitory 13 for international students.",
10377,"And again quarantine was imposed, and now 540 people, complying with the requirements of Rospotrebnadzor, were kept indoor.",
10378,"Fortunately, thanks to the timely measures taken, everyone is also healthy there.",
10379,"We must pay tribute to the students who found themselves in such a difficult situation: they kept firm, did not whine and did not complain.",
10380,We asked some of them to share their feelings about the ordeal.,
10381,"Bibars Bara, graduate of the 3rd course in Advertising and Public Relations: The quarantine period was quite difficult, a little chaotic in the beginning, and this is understandable, since there is no experience with such situations, but I think the leaders of Polytechnic University did everything possible.",
10382,All students living in dormitories were paid material assistance; every day doctors measured the temperature of all of us; masks and antiseptics could be found in the kitchens and corridors; there was an opportunity to contact a psychologist free of charge.,
10383,It should also be noted that the commandant of the dormitory was always in touch and did everything she could to listen to and reassure the students.,
10384,"At first, only three floors were closed and only one person from each room was allowed to go out once in two days to a shop or to a pharmacy, to buy everything necessary for themselves and their neighbors.",
10385,"Then the dormitory was completely closed; groceries could be bought only online and received only through a security guard or volunteers inside the dormitory, who, in my opinion, did a huge and amazing job!",
10386,"It was possible to cook twice a day, according to the schedule, each block had 30 minutes; cleaners cleaned all the corridors on daily basis, sometimes twice a day.",
10387,"The staff of the Higher School of Media Communications and Public Relations, where I study, were also in touch with all the students who were in quarantine, supported them morally, and brought food.",
10388,They even prepared a surprise for a girl for her birthday: they brought her a cake and gifts!,
10389,"While we were in quarantine, the session started and the preparation for it took all the time.",
10390,"I can say that this is, of course, was an unforgettable period, although not in a good sense.",
10391,I am sure that the university management did everything they could to make sure that the quarantine would end safely for the students.,
10392,"I hope that this will not happen again, neither here nor elsewhere.”",
10393,"Abubaker Issa, Master\s degree graduate in Software Engineering, ICST: There were people who had a hard time withstanding quarantine, but it went well for me.",
10394,"I had time to focus on my dissertation, time to practice what I learned at university, and time to relax.",
10395,"When we wanted to buy groceries, we would order them online, and the volunteers assigned to us by Polytechnic University would bring them.",
10396,"The union supported us financially, and the PolyUnion club helped the students at the preparatory faculties.",
10397,"Nguyeng-Hang, graduate of the 2nd year in Advertising and Public Relations: During the quarantine, I felt a little scared at first, but I was able to cope.",
10398,"I tried to clean the room thoroughly, wash my hands often, wear a mask while cooking, and follow the rules of the dormitory.",
10399,"Polytechnic University was very helpful, sending us food, masks and gloves.",
10400,"In addition, the university staff cheered us up when we were isolated.",
10401,I used to exercise in my room to stay healthy and prepare for exams.,
10402,"Of course, it was a hard time, but I had to go through it to protect myself and others.",
10403,"I have good memories about the help from Polytechnic University, which supported us both physically and morally, from which I can conclude that Polytechnic University is a very good and friendly school.",
10404,"Thank you very much, Polytechnic University.",
10405,"As of 15 June, Polytechnic University has partially lifted its austerity measures during the pandemic, and as of 28 June, some restrictions in the campus were lifted.",
10406,"However, the university management urges all employees and students not to relax.",
10407,"The risk remains, so it is necessary to maintain the increased requirements for the admission regime on the campus and to support the work of the special zone of residence in the Student campus,” suggested at an online meeting of the SPbPU Academic Council Vladimir GLUHOV, head of the administrative staff of the rector and the operational headquarters to counter the spread of coronavirus infection.",
10408,"“This experience should be preserved for the future, to use in any situation that may arise there.",
10409,"I also believe that it is necessary to create a special commission on safety and emergency situations aircraft with the highest governing body of the university, i.e., the Academic Council.",
10410,"Rector of SPbPU Andrei Rudskoi supported the proposal to form a commission: We need such a working body at the Academic Council, because the challenges arise quite unexpected.",
10411,"Figuratively speaking, it\s too early to cover weapons.",
10412,The situation is very difficult in St. Petersburg; there may be a surge in late August when students from the regions return here.,
10413,"We\ll consult with the ministry, but we must realize that maybe we\ll continue our distance learning.”
",
10414,After more than two weeks of self-isolation someone could think that the rules have been relaxed.,
10415,"We can see more people going outdoors, wandering the streets, meeting friends, etc.",
10416,"The Statistics shows the effects from that: for April 12 in Russia there were more than 15,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19).",
10417,"Among them 2,186 new cases were revealed yesterday.",
10418,"Here is the important information about Polytechnics:   Dear students, despite the good weather and apparent well-being, we should not relax and take the situation irresponsibly.",
10419,We know the cases when some of our students try to enter other dormitories usung someone elses pass.,
10420,"Dont you think that such behaviour is not smart, and you just put other people at risk?, More than 700 students of the St. Petersburg I.I. Mechnikov State Medical Academy were placed under quarantine in the dormitory on Prospekt Prosvescheniya.",
10421,They had spend in isolation 2 weeks without being able to go outside.,
10422,Just think of it: 2 weeks without fresh air.,
10423,700 people!,
10424,"Please, be conscious and prudent.",
10425,Dont relax and take the situation irresponsibly.,
10426,The virus forgives no negligence!,
10427,"Do not neglect the rules of life dictated by the pandemic, take care of yourself and stay home!
",
10428,Vaccination of international students at Polytechnic University continues.,
10429,"Since the end of August, when a large-scale campaign started, more than 700 foreign citizens who study at SPbPU have already been vaccinated against coronavirus.",
10430,There have been significant changes in the organization of the vaccination procedure since the beginning of November.,
10431,"For the convenience of foreign students, a weekly shuttle service to Polyclinic № 68 in Sestroretsk has been organized.",
10432,By agreement between the clinic and the university administration international students of SPbPU can get a coronavirus vaccine «Sputnik Lite» on more favorable terms than in other medical institutions of St. Petersburg.,
10433,"To make an appointment for vaccination, as well as to get a detailed consultation, foreign citizens need to send an application to the e-mail address nedelko_ps@spbstu.ru.",
10434,"In the application form, it is necessary to specify the surname, first name and patronymic (if any), name of the institute, group number, and contact phone number.",
10435,The weekly transfer is organized at the university primarily for the convenience and safety of international students.,
10436,"We are closely monitoring the current situation, which, unfortunately, is not easy at the moment, commented Pavel NEDELKO, assistant vice-rector for international affairs at SPbPU.",
10437,"At the same time, we are focused on organizing extracurricular activities for our foreigners, because besides medical care they all certainly need moral support.",
10438,The current epidemiological situation imposes several restrictions on extracurricular activities.,
10439,"For example, offline activities in the international PolyUnion student club are now limited to a simultaneous number of participants of up to 40 people (subject to all measures against coronavirus infection).",
10440,TutorForces is also switching to a mixed mode of operation.,
10441,We surveyed our international students about their preferences for activities.,
10442,"As expected, the majority were in favor of keeping live communication as much as possible, albeit with limitations, said PolyUnion head Shukrona ZARIPOVA.",
10443,"Of course, we will try to take into account the wishes of the students and alternate offline and online events.",
10444,"We will continue to hold meetings, conversation clubs, film screenings, online games, and much more.",
10445,"To keep up with the latest news, we recommend subscribing to the accounts of the international student organizations at Polytechnic University for international students in social networks.",
10446,"The official TutorForces pages can be found here: Facebook, Vkontakte, and Instagram.",
10447,"PolyUnion Interclub accounts are available at these links: Facebook, Vkontakte, Instagram.
",
10448,The Tutor Forces tutoring service at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University has turned exactly five years old.,
10449,"From year to year, its members — tutors — help international students from SPbPU to adapt to life in Russia, solve educational and everyday problems, and hold various events.",
10450,"During this time, several generations of tutors have changed within the walls of Polytechnic University, but the core values of the service remain the same.",
10451,"The Tutor Forces are not just a team of like-minded people, it is a close-knit family of Polytechnic students who always help foreign students to get accustomed to the educational and cultural environment.",
10452,"Pavel NEDELKO, the Tutor Forces’ founder and ideological inspirer, deputy director of Higher School of International Educational Programs of SPbPU, told about what new happened in the life of tutors during the past years and about the plans for the next «five years».",
10453,"— Pavel, when you created the Tutor Forces, what goals did you set for yourself?",
10454,"Five years later, can you say that you are moving in the direction you originally planned?",
10455,— The idea originally came from the SPbPU International Office.,
10456,"Every year the staff was looking for Russian students who wanted to participate in the buddy program — to meet international applicants and students, to be involved in the organization of the welcome week.",
10457,"At that time, this was most often solved with the help of student interns, but as such a well-established system did not exist.",
10458,I liked the idea.,
10459,"I at that time just became responsible for the extracurricular training of foreign students in the foundation university program, and I was in acute need of assistants.",
10460,"Therefore, our main goal was to create a sustainable system, through which the Russian students of Polytech could help foreigners adapt to Russia.",
10461,"Five years later, we can say that we have succeeded.",
10462,"The organization exists and develops, new projects appear all the time, the recognition is growing.",
10463,"There have been several generations of tutors in the organization, the heads, whom we call «presidents,» have changed, but every year our Tutor Forces are ready to meet new international students who come to Russia and help and support them.",
10464,— How much has the scale of your activity changed in five years?,
10465,— Let me give you an example of our event activities.,
10466,"In 2016, tutors held only 7 events, which were attended by about 150 foreigners.",
10467,And in 2019 we have organized more than 40 diverse events for more than a thousand students.,
10468,"In addition, in 2018, we opened the international student club PolyUnion, where all extracurricular work with international students is concentrated, and where the Tutor Forces are residents.",
10469,"There are regular language clubs, film screenings, national parties, and more.",
10470,"Every year we start with the official opening of the Interclub season, then we celebrate Interclub Birthday (November 22), then New Year, Shrovetide.",
10471,"This year, the guys decided to celebrate Nowruz, the holiday of spring.",
10472,The year ends with the official closing ceremony of the season.,
10473,And the main organizer of all these events is the Tutor Forces team.,
10474,"— Speaking of events, which ones are your most memorable?",
10475,— I would highlight a few.,
10476,The opening and the next year’s birthday celebration of the Interclub.,
10477,"These events were held in the presence of distinguished guests, and the tutors showed a very high level of professionalism in organizing events.",
10478,"Celebration of New Year «DIY Christmas tree» because it is always fun, easy and family-style.",
10479,Foreigners are already more or less settling in and starting to feel at home by this point.,
10480,It’s so nice to see!,
10481,"And, perhaps, Nowruz.",
10482,We celebrated it for the first time in 2021.,
10483,"The guys wanted to organize it for a long time, but various circumstances kept getting in the way.",
10484,"This year, too, the coronavirus pandemic made restrictions, but still, Nowruz took place, albeit in a somewhat truncated format.",
10485,Next year we want to turn it into a real festival!,
10486,"— Were there any difficulties, difficulties during these 5 years?",
10487,"Were there any problems that foreign students approached you with, and which were successfully resolved?",
10488,"— There were difficulties, of course.",
10489,"At the initial stage, it was building the work of the organization, understanding the goals and objectives.",
10490,I remember that we met with the students every week to decide what and how we would do next.,
10491,"Then there was a difficult moment when the first group of presidents, who were at the very beginning of the organization, left, and we had to hand over power to the new presidents.",
10492,"All this coincided with the pandemic, so the new guys had to urgently learn crisis-management skills.",
10493,But the organization persevered and rebuilt itself.,
10494,"The problems with which international students come to the Tutor Forces are sometimes difficult, but, let’s say, commonplace.",
10495,"Someone needs to be met (sometimes late at night), someone needs help with the paperwork, someone has lost his passport and asks to go to the police with it.",
10496,"There were different situations, but the tutors managed to solve them all.",
10497,— What do you think Tutor Forces has become for international students?,
10498,— Tutor Forces is a big family for both tutors and international students.,
10499,They are always happy to help.,
10500,"The kids walk, learn and socialize together.",
10501,I was very glad to see that starting from the second Tutor School international students who had been studying at Polytech for several years and wanted to help their compatriots joined the organization.,
10502,"It was these guys who later became an asset of the PolyUnion Interclub, which has now evolved from just a venue for events into a separate student organization.",
10503,— Does the management of Polytechnic University support your endeavors?,
10504,—,
10505,The university administration pays a lot of attention to international students and all projects related to the internationalization of higher education.,
10506,The Tutor Forces are not exempt from this attention.,
10507,"For example, with the appearance of the Interclub, the opening of which attended the Rector of SPbPU Andrei Rudskoi, the Tutors got a permanent platform for meetings and events.",
10508,"We would like to express the gratitude of the Tutor Forces team to Dmitry G. Arseniev, vice-rector for international affairs, and Viktor V. Krasnoschekov, director of HS IEP, who eagerly respond to new tutors’ initiatives and render comprehensive support.",
10509,"It is important that the tutors understand that their work is important for the university, they see their results, they see that the life of international students is becoming more interesting and comfortable.",
10510,— How did Tutor Forces change during the pandemic?,
10511,"What was done, what was new in your work?",
10512,"— The pandemic had a great impact on all international activities, including the work of the Tutor Forces.",
10513,"There are fewer international students, and many have returned home to continue studying remotely.",
10514,"The Tutor Forces’ activities also shifted to an online format, where the guys held conversation clubs, film screenings followed by discussions, virtual tours, and launched a series of podcasts.",
10515,"Last year, during the height of the pandemic, an information center for international students was organized with the participation of tutors to provide advice on lump-sum financial aid payments.",
10516,Tutors became volunteers during the observation of dormitory #13 and also launched a flashmob in support of international students «WE ARE TOGETHER».,
10517,— What do you need to become a tutor now?,
10518,"— To become a Student Tutor, you need to attend the Tutor School, where you will get acquainted with our structure, learn more about international students and international office of Polytechnic University, and be taught all the necessary skills.",
10519,"But if you don’t want to be a member of the organization, but you want to communicate with international students, you can always join Tutor Forces’ events as a volunteer.",
10520,— What plans do tutors have for the new five years?,
10521,What tasks do you set for yourself?,
10522,"— Even though when cooperating with similar organizations at other universities, many have noted the high level of Tutor Forces’ work, the main task for the team is to continually improve the quality of the events and the training of tutors.",
10523,"In the next year, until the pandemic recedes, we plan to create projects related to the creation of online content, remote communication, and support.",
10524,"As soon as it becomes possible, we will develop the excursion direction, as it is always very popular among foreigners.",
10525,"We have planned a number of projects in cooperation with other organizations of Polytechnic University, our old friends and partners: SPbPU Student Council, Harmony Center, YESLAB, and CPVM Rodina.",
10526,I am sure that all of this will come to fruition.,
10527,"— Pavel, we have no doubts about it either!",
10528,"Good luck to you, and wish you new achievements!
",
10529,"In the beginning of a new academic year, when several thousands of students joint our Polytechnic family, we decided to raise a topic of health.",
10530,"Studentship is not only the brightest and memorable part of our life, but also it is the time of serious loads, when the energy consumption is very intensive.",
10531,About healthy lifestyle and why it is important to take care about health from ones youth have continually told RAMS academician V.A. CHERESHNEV himself.,
10532,Today we continue our conversation with a Chief Physician of Polyclinic №76 O.V. ALESHKO.,
10533,In her previous interview a Chief Physician told us about the work of entrusted her medical facility.,
10534,"Today together with her colleague, the candidate of medical Sciences, head of the therapy Department, Chairman of the Medical Commission R.M. BITSADZE Oksana Valerievna told how they take care of the health of Polytechnic students (which includes foreign and international students), which services they can get at the Polyclinic, and why the time they spend in the queue depends only on them.",
10535,"- Oksana Valerievna, in your previous interview you told that it was necessary to be attached to the Polyclinic where you would like to get medical services.",
10536,"But if you are a student (especially a Polytechnic student), you can be provided witha polyclinic care without any attachment.",
10537,Is it true?,
10538,-,
10539,The federal statute urges people to exercise their right to choose a medical organization.,
10540,"If you have chosen a Polyclinic and would like to be attached to it, come and write an application.",
10541,"Being attached is a better way, because the amount of medical assistance in this case is more significant, than for those who are not attached to a Polyclinic.",
10542,-Your major customers are students.,
10543,Which medical services do they have at your Polyclinic?,
10544,-,
10545,Mainly we really work with students: annually we provide with a polyclinic care about 66 thousand people.,
10546,We have agreements with institutions and colleges.,
10547,"In many of these organizations there are our medical stations, every institution has its own therapeutic who reserved to it.",
10548,"We provide medical examinations approved by the Ministry of health: it is periodic health examination of special groups of adults (down to the age of 21), medical examinations before Physical Exercises lessons and GTO program.",
10549,A special privilege of our Polyclinic is that according to the General tariff agreement with the city we have right (as distinct from other Polyclinics) to provide a preventive medical examinations of students who live in St. Petersburg.,
10550,As far as there are a lot of international students they also have an opportunity to have medical examinations according to CHI funds where they have been registered.,
10551,"So you should have Complete Medical Insurance policy, personal insurance policy number (SNILS) and passport.",
10552,- So international students can also attend your Polyclinic?,
10553,"- They should have Private medical insurance (DMS certificate), and our Polyclinic should be written in this certificate.",
10554,"If some medical services are not mentioned in the certificate, they should be paid from their personal finances.",
10555,"What for international students, here it is very important to find common ground between university and polyclinic.",
10556,"The fact is that the students who come from countries of the far abroad (more often than not, from Africa, Asia, South America) can be potential carriers of dangerous diseases.",
10557,That is why for them there are so called barrier examinations.,
10558,It is clearly defined algorithm of medical examinations and professional advice.,
10559,"It is important to understand that if a student returns back from holidays from his or her country, it is necessary to have this barrier examination.",
10560,"I definitely know that universities understand this, but not everyone controls it properly.,",
10561,- Is it right that any student or teacher from SPbPU can get a flu shot at your Polyclinic? -,
10562,Of course!,
10563,"For example, Rector of SPbPU, Professor A.I. Rudskoy and lots of SPbPU representatives did this just a few days ago.",
10564,"I hope you understand that vaccination is necessary, because universities are organized communities, and the more people there are, the more contacts they have.",
10565,It is very important for university authorities to understand that we need help to convey information to students and academic staff.,
10566,-,
10567,"Besides vaccination, at your polyclinic people can have preventive medical check-up.",
10568,How can they do that?,
10569,-,
10570,For a long time weve had the queue system.,
10571,"But nowadays we separated doctors who provide medical check-ups, and specialists who provide medical examinations.",
10572,"We have a principle: medical check-ups should be provided only according to the time-table!, - Could you please tell us about the Center for reproductive health that works at your Polyclinic?",
10573,-,
10574,Our Center was founded in 2014.,
10575,The specialists who work there can holistically research the state of health of teenagers from 15 years and young people under 24 years of age from the point of view of reproductive potential.,
10576,"We have a team work at our Center: urologist, endocrinologist, gynecologist, psychologist and psychotherapist, skin and venereal diseases – they are professionals who are involved as in narrow issues of the patient, as in his mental and emotional state.",
10577,- What are the most popular problems the students apply at your Center?,
10578,- Very often it is loss of a cycle.,
10579,Why do we have a comprehensive work of an endocrinologist and a gynecologist?,
10580,"Because when a woman has a loss of a cycle, there is impossible to define a clear diagnostic without an endocrinologist.",
10581,"This specialist should identify the problem: it can be diabetes, hyperprolactinemia (pituitary disease) and so on.",
10582,"Only when an endocrinologist solves this problem, a gynecologist starts working.",
10583,"A patient is not separated from one of the specialists, they can communicate with each other and treat the patient together.",
10584,Also many young people come to the psychologist’s office.,
10585,Emotional breakdowns are not uncommon among the students.,
10586,We rapidly develop the work of psychologists and psychotherapist in connection with universities.,
10587,One of the main tasks is to define a psychological status of first-year students.,
10588,"We should understand what we can expect from people who have just entered the university, and to prevent various negative accidents.",
10589,"Some of them are comfortable with new surroundings, dormitories; some people with the first days of their studying have emotional disorders.",
10590,"Along with that our specialists work with the students according to anti-drug, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking programs.",
10591,"We provide different lectures and cinema events, and the students attend it with interest.",
10592,"- What can you advise to students to stay healthy, to study properly and become a good specialist?",
10593,- You are absolutely right speaking to become a good specialist.,
10594,Imagine the situation when two graduates start working at some company.,
10595,"One of them is often sick, and even if he is at work, he complains of headache or something like that.",
10596,"Another works without a sick leave, because he takes care about his health.",
10597,Who is more productive?,
10598,"Of course, the second person!",
10599,"A boss can rely on him, and commit a serious task to him.",
10600,"In one word, a good specialist is a healthy specialist.",
10601,And this should be founded in the times of studentship.,
10602,"According to the statistics, the majority of students have visual, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems diseases.",
10603,"It is the result of long hours they spend working at the computer, and lack of fresh air and physical activities.",
10604,"So you should have a rational mode of work and rest, get rid of bad habits, and eat healthy food.",
10605,"It means that the energy you get should be the same as the energy your spend, and chemical composition of the diet should be in congruence with the needs of your body in nutrient materials.",
10606,"And, of course, do not forget about physical activities, tempering and bathing habits.

10607,"Govshut Perniyazov, a student of the Graduate School of International Relations at SPbPU, won in the category «Organization of Interethnic and International Cooperation (Tolerance)» in the university stage of the Student of the Year contest.",
10608,The contest was organized by the Department of Youth Policy of SPbPU and was held for the first time this year.,
10609,"According to its results, Govshut Perniyazov moved on to the next stage and will represent Polytechnic University in the Student of the Year city contest.",
10610,"Govshut Perniyazov came to St. Petersburg from Turkmenistan, and today he is the head of the Turkmen community of Polytechnic University.",
10611,"He directed the organization of eight events at the university, in which more than 1,000 foreign students from different countries took part.",
10612,"We try to actively participate in the university life, hold student events of various kinds.",
10613,"Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has made its adjustments, and today we are largely focused on solving the problems caused by it, commented Govshut PERNIYAZOV.",
10614,"In all, about 500 students from Turkmenistan study at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.",
10615,"Thanks to the joint work of the Turkmen community and the administration of SPbPU, the university has established a clear system for working with students from Turkmenistan, who receive all the important information, give feedback and have the opportunity to report their problems.",
10616,"During the coronavirus pandemic, many regular university events were postponed or transferred to a remote format.",
10617,Several tasks had to be dealt with quickly.,
10618,International students from SPbPU joined in the work on them.,
10619,"For example, with Govshut’s participation, a volunteer headquarters was organized to help international students who found themselves in observation at the dormitory; information support was provided to students in the process of receiving a one-time financial aid from the university and during the coronavirus vaccination period.",
10620,"The past year has not been easy for many of us, above all for international students who are away from family and home.",
10621,"Despite everything, we unite and help each other.",
10622,"At any time, it’s important to be together and act together.",
10623,"But especially now, said Govshut PERNIYAZOV.
",
10624,"A graduate of Polytechnic University, street artist Vasily TSVETKOV continues his series of portraits of outstanding engineers in the university campus.",
10625,"In honor of the 75th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, the creator and first chief designer of the T-34 tank, Mikhail KOSHKIN, became the new graffiti hero in the courtyard of the Mechanical Building.",
10626,"“Two years ago, such images began to appear in the premises of our campus,” Maxim PASHOLIKOV, Vice-Rector for Youth Affairs of SPbPU, said live on the St. Petersburg TV channel.",
10627,“Students-members of Our Polytech Historical Club proposed a project that would popularize science and contribute to the patriotic education of youth within the university.,
10628,"Our graduate, already a well-known St. Petersburg artist, volunteered to do that and for two years, he has been making such portraits.”",
10629,The vice-rector emphasized that in the campus there are support structures on which graffiti can be placed.,
10630,"“Of course, there are certain stages of coordination, but it is somewhat easier than in the city.",
10631,"Our students are very happy about this,” he concluded.",
10632,"In 1929, at the age of 30, KOSHKIN got enrolled in the Leningrad Technological Institute, among the “party-thousanders,” but the field of study was not appealing for him, and he successfully insisted on the transfer to the engineering department of the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute.",
10633,"In 1934, he graduated as a mechanical engineer majoring in “construction of vehicles and tractors;” the theme of his graduation project was “Gearbox of a Battle Tank”.",
10634,"Under his direction, the most widespread tank of World War II and the postwar period was developed: the legendary T-34.",
10635,Vasily TSVETKOV commented that the creation of graffiti in the SPbPU campus was a whole project.,
10636,"He noted that without support of the university’s leadership, nothing could have been implemented.",
10637,"At first, the sketch goes through many stages of coordination, because several generations of the Polytechnic will go through their student lives with this portrait.",
10638,The place was also chosen with awareness and for a long time.,
10639,The new graffiti is located on a transformer box ten meters away from the building where Mikhail KOSHKIN studied.,
10640,“We also were asked when we studied if we knew the Nobel Prize winners and other prominent personalities from Polytechnic University.,
10641,We could say nothing about that.,
10642,This project is primarily educational in its nature.,
10643,"I myself am excited about working on the portraits, I learned a lot.",
10644,"In addition, we are transforming the dreary view of gray booths,” said Vasily TSVETKOV.
",
10645,"The Nobel Prize winner, an outstanding scientist whose biography is closely intertwined with the life of SPbPU, Zhores I. ALFYOROV became the new hero of Vasily TsVETKOVs graffiti., Zhores Alferov often emphasized the role of Polytechnic University in his life.",

10865,"Tanuj himself says about it: In my free time, I paint pictures and try to say through them that life is amazing.",
10866,"Sometimes it’s difficult, but in the end we always see the best side of it.",
10867,The idea to capture on paper Polytechnic University came to Tanuja recently.,
10868,"He painted the famous Water Tower in bright, juicy colors, and in his blog he told why he had made such a choice: “This is like a symbol of our university - Peter The Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University, and in the time of the pandemic, this university took care of us like a mother take care of her own child, University helped us with everything from providing us Financial assistance to taking care of our health, they also provided food to some students also, for expressing my gratitude towards the University and the authorities working day-night to help students, and keep everyone safe, I painted this.",
10869,"Another reason was I never got the chance to see the greenery in University Park, so I imagine that the University park looks like this in the summertime, after the lockdown ended I tried to go inside the campus to take the photo in front of this tower but, the university gates are closed from all the sides, so I had to take this picture at the front gate of University”.",
10870,"Tanuj likes to depict famous people and heroes in his paintings, make sketches of landscapes.",
10871,This is how he gets to know this world where he dreams of becoming a researcher: I chose mechanical engineering because I was interested in the mysteries of the Universe from my childhood and always wanted to solve them.,
10872,"So my childhood dream was to become a scientist”, - Tanuj says.
",
10873,Under the program Erasmus+ fourth year student of Institute of Civil Engineering (ICE of SPbPU),
10874,"Rania BAEVA had a five-month internship at Leibniz Universität Hannover (LUH), and on arrival shared her impressions.",
10875,"Today in our interview: how to take part in Erasmus+ programs, what documents are necessary, what educational process there is at Leibniz Universität Hannover and lots of other interesting facts.",
10876,"– Rania, why did you decide to take part in Erasmus+ program?",
10877,"– I have always dreamt of internship in a foreign country, and without any hesitation agreed to take part in Erasmus+ program.",
10878,"But you should be ready to competitive admissions: at first you should submit documents about your academic progress and a reference letter from your institute, and then you will have an interview in English.",
10879,"I successfully completed the whole tasks, and started preparing all the necessary documents.",
10880,It is very important to note that your documents should be translated into English or German.,
10881,– What documents do you need to study abroad?,
10882,Are there any difficulties with them?,
10883,"– To take part in Erasmus+ program you should have a copy of your report card, testimonial letter from your institute, and also an approximate list of the subjects you would like to study at a foreign university.",
10884,"There are no any problems with documents preparation: international offices of both of the universities do a good work, and are ready to answer any question.",
10885,"Most of all I was worried about my visa, but it is found out that if you are Erasmus+ student, visa is got ready in a short period of time, and, what is more, you do not need to pay a fee.",
10886,"In SPbPU site you can learn all the necessary information - for example, to read a list of Partner Universities.",
10887,– Is health insurance compulsory for students?,
10888,"– Yes, it is compulsory for all the students.",
10889,You can make it in Germany; it costs about EUR90 per month.,
10890,–,
10891,And what is about cost of living in Germany?,
10892,Was your scholarship enough for all the expenses?,
10893,–,
10894,"Yes, absolutely!",
10895,"My scholarship was about EUR800 per month, and it covered all my expenses.",
10896,"But you should take into account the fact that you will get your scholarship only in two or three weeks after arrival, so you have to have your own money for this time.",
10897,– What about your impressions after your internship?,
10898,Did you like it?,
10899,– I went to study abroad at such times when I really needed it.,
10900,This internship was very useful for me.,
10901,I could essentially improve my English and speak much more fluently than earlier.,
10902,"It was very interesting to deep into multicultural atmosphere, and now I have new ideas, new goals.",
10903,– Tell us about educational process at LUH. –,
10904,At Leibniz Universität Hannover I studied some disciplines which were similar with those I studied at ICE.,
10905,"For example, I really liked a subject Sanitary Engineering.",
10906,Also we had a very interesting discipline called Image analysis.,
10907,The professors taught us how to make maps from ordinary photos.,
10908,The classes were interactive and intensive.,
10909,Teachers used presentations for every lesson.,
10910,"Also there were very good libraries with computers and Wi-Fi., – What also stood out in your memory?",
10911,– The university works nonstop.,
10912,"On the first floor there are tables with wall sockets, and it is always difficult to find a free seat.",
10913,"The library is also always crowded, especially when students pass their exams.",
10914,"It opens at 8:00 a.m., and at 9:00 a.m.",
10915,you will hardly find a spare place.,
10916,"I really loved to study in a library at LUH, and came there in spite of the fact that I lived alone in my dormitory room.",
10917,–,
10918,"And what is about dormitories, canteen?",
10919,–,
10920,The canteen was very good.,
10921,The food there was tasty and not expensive.,
10922,The dormitories at LUH have blocked structure: in every block usually live about 10 people.,
10923,Every person has his or her own room.,
10924,"The cost is not very high: I paid EUR210 per month, but there also were more expensive variants.",
10925,– Now about the scariest thing: exams!,
10926,– A compulsory condition of participation in Erasmus+ program is that at the end of your studying you should get at least 15 credits after passing your exams.,
10927,"If you do not do that, you will have to return back all your scholarship.",
10928,Every exam brings you about 5 credits.,
10929,"Except credits, you will also have mark: it should be at least middle-level.",
10930,In this case you will have your credits.,
10931,There are two types of exams in Germany: in written and oral forms.,
10932,– How did you pass your exams?,
10933,– Once I had to pass a writing exam.,
10934,"I had 36 sheets of paper, where tasks were printed on a one side.",
10935,"I had to write short or full answers, draw schemes, continue a thought, etc.",
10936,"When you pass such an exam, you dont have time to think: you read a question, and should write an answer immediately.",
10937,Near every task there is a number of points you can get if you solve it.,
10938,These points also mean an amount of time which is recommended to spend on the task.,
10939,", When you pass an oral examination, an examiner cannot administer it alone: there are at least two professors in a classroom.",
10940,"You also have time limits: for example, some answers should be no longer than 7 minutes and 30 seconds.",
10941,And not a second more!,
10942,– Were there any problems with communication?,
10943,– I did not have any problems: all the people were friendly and nice.,
10944,"Also when I just came to Germany I had a funny incident: in the beginning of my education I lost the way to my dormitory, and couldnt find it.",
10945,"I saw some hospital, came there and said to security guard that I got lost, and I didnt have a map or Internet.",
10946,"So he found in his computer my dormitory, draw me a map, and I happily returned back home., – Did you have time to travel?",
10947,What impressed you?,
10948,"– While studying in Germany I visited Berlin, Munich, Celle, Hamburg.",
10949,I really loved Munich: I think it is one of the most beautiful cities in Germany.,
10950,Also I was very impressed with Neuschwanstein Castle in southwest Bavaria.,
10951,"I also travelled abroad and visited Paris, Amsterdam and Prague.",
10952,"I went there by bus, and stayed in hostel, so my scholarship was enough.",
10953,– And our traditional question: what would you advise to the students who would like to study abroad?,
10954,– Get out of your comfort zone!,
10955,Never give up and believe in yourself.,
10956,"It was not my first try to study abroad, but I didnt lose hope, and finally could go to Germany.",
10957,"Do not forget: you hold the keys to the kingdom!, – Rania, thank you very much for the interesting interview!",
10958,"Wish you good luck and new achievements!

10959,Krayani Hussein Ali came to Russia from Lebanon about 10 years ago.,
10960,His life is closely connected with Polytechnic university:,
10961,"first, he studied here in the university foundation program, then - he began to teach mathematics to Russian and foreign students.",
10962,"He also studied astronomy at a university in St. Petersburg, has been to many Russian cities, has excellent knowledge of the Russian language, and has visited the Hermitage at least 50 times.",
10963,"In an interview with SPbPU International Office, Krayani Hussein Ali spoke about how to master Russian from scratch and why he teaches mathematics in English, and also gave valuable advice to future foreign students and teachers at Polytech.",
10964,"- Hussein, tell us why you decided to come to Russia?Hussein, tell us why you decided to come to Russia?",
10965,"- Since childhood, I loved technical subjects - mathematics, physics, astronomy.",
10966,"I did well in school, and after graduation, I started looking for opportunities to study abroad.",
10967,I chose between two countries - Russia and Germany.,
10968,"At the same time, because I was afraid of not getting a visa, I entered the Lebanese University and even studied there for a while.",
10969,But then they gave me a visa and an invitation and I came to Russia.,
10970,At that time I didn’t know Russian at all.,
10971,-,
10972,"So you arrived in a totally unfamiliar country, with strange people around you, no one spoke your native language, and, you must admit, the climate was different.",
10973,What were your first impressions?,
10974,- I arrived in Russia together with the other students.,
10975,"As I remember now, we were met by two women who didn’t speak a word of English, and I’m still surprised that they found us and how we managed to understand each other.",
10976,I only found out which city I was going to at the Moscow airport.,
10977,"At first, I thought I was going to Rostov-on-Don, but then it turned out that I was going to St. Petersburg.",
10978,"And, by the way, it was on the way to St. Petersburg, sitting in the Sapsan compartment, that I first became acquainted with the character of Russian people.",
10979,- Tell us about that incident - what was it like?,
10980,"- I arrived in Russia, and I had a fever.",
10981,On the train it got really bad -,
10982,I knew I had to take medicine right away.,
10983,And there was no water to drink the pills with.,
10984,"I went to buy a bottle of water, but my money was in dollars and I didn’t have time to change it.",
10985,And they only took rubles.,
10986,"While we were trying to sort things out, some man, seeing that I did not feel well, came over and bought me the water.",
10987,"I offered to give him the money, but he refused.",
10988,When people help each other - this is about humanity.,
10989,I think that’s how it should be.,
10990,But it’s a little frustrating that the train staff at the time did not go out of their way and they didn’t have a glass of water to just drink the medicine.,
10991,"And, by the way, this was not my last adventure of the day.",
10992,- Here I want to ask - and then what happened?,
10993,- Then a friend from Lebanon met me at the Moscow station.,
10994,"Since he spoke Arabic, life became easier and clearer.",
10995,We drove to the metro station Akademicheskaya and we went to eat pancakes.,
10996,"That’s how that day, for the first time in my life I took a plane, commuter train, metro, “Sapsan,” and tasted pancakes.",
10997,"It was January 9, 2010.",
10998,- Were the pancakes good?,
10999,- They were great!,
11000,- They were great!,
11001,-,
11002,The first two weeks were especially difficult.,
11003,"I had to take medical tests, and those few days while I was waiting for the results, I was terribly afraid that something would go wrong and I would have to leave Russia.",
11004,And then a few days go by,
11005,"and they call me and say: Come, there are questions about so-and-so indicators.",
11006,"It even took my breath away, but then it turned out that it was just a mistake and everything was fine.",
11007,The fact that I didn\t know anyone in Russia and didn\t have any friends also added to the difficulties.,
11008,I lived on the outskirts and didn\t even know that there was such an incredibly beautiful historic center in St. Petersburg.,
11009,-,
11010,When did you realize that you were beginning to get used to Russia?,
11011,"- In about three or four months, when I had already begun to understand Russian a little bit.",
11012,"We developed a very good relationship with our Russian neighbor, we went for walks, discussed history and politics.",
11013,And gradually things got better.,
11014,- You speak Russian very well now.,
11015,And how did you learn it?,
11016,"- We had a very good teacher, Darya Skubchenko, who still works at SPbPU.I did my best, did all my homework, and communicated a lot in Russian.",
11017,"Of course, there were not only “A’s” - I got “B’s” and “C’s” as well.",
11018,"After four months, we were already discussing historical questions with our neighbors.",
11019,"Our teacher also gave additional tasks - to watch a video clip, a film, to communicate with my friend in Russian.",
11020,"In general, I think that if you come to a country to learn its language and continue to communicate in your native language – it’s just a shame.",
11021,Youll never succeed that way.,
11022,Communicate with classmates who are not from your country.,
11023,"Otherwise, you will never learn the language.",
11024,"I have a story to prove it.,",
11025,"- Tell us, which one? -",
11026,There was one case - it was told by our chemistry teacher.,
11027,"It happened that one day there were nine people from Latin America and one, I think, Chinese, in the same group.",
11028,"He did not know Russian very well, but by the end of the school year, he spoke fluent Spanish.",
11029,"I mean, how much communication with my classmates influences the process of learning a language.",
11030,"If there were guys from Russia in his group, he would have learned Russian.",
11031,"But as it is, he would start speaking Spanish.",
11032,"To tell the truth, I don’t know how it helped him in Russia.",
11033,"- As far as we know, even though you know Russian very well, you teach mathematics in English.",
11034,What does this have to do with?,
11035,-,
11036,"In Lebanon, they taught mathematics in English.",
11037,I know “mathematical English” quite well.,
11038,"Here at Polytechnic University, I started by teaching foreign students, later I switched to mixed groups - where there are both Russians and foreigners.",
11039,In November it will be three years since I taught mathematics in Russia.,
11040,-,
11041,And why did you decide to teach at Polytechnic University?,
11042,-,
11043,"When I graduated from the SPbPU pre-university program, I continued to communicate with many teachers.",
11044,I found out from them that there was a vacancy.,
11045,"My future colleagues introduced me to Victor Krasnoschekov, director of the Higher School of International Educational Programs, and after the interview, I started to work.",
11046,-,
11047,And what do you plan to do in the future?,
11048,"- To continue to teach, also to be engaged in science, translations, international activity.",
11049,I also like organizing different events.,
11050,I enjoy cultural life and symphony concerts.,
11051,"I had a very good friend, an astronomer and musician.",
11052,It was our professor Veniamin Vityazev.,
11053,He held wonderful amateur concerts where students performed.,
11054,"Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018.",
11055,Then we organized a concert in honor of him in the White Hall of SPbPU.,
11056,"After Professor Vityazev’s illness, I started holding concerts at the faculty where I studied, and I plan to continue this and hold concerts here at Polytechnic University and IMOP when the pandemic is over.",
11057,- How often do you visit museums and cultural sites in Russia?,
11058,- Often!,
11059,I’ve been to the Hermitage about fifty times.,
11060,"I love the Russian Museum, the Local History Museum, the Museum of the History of St. Petersburg, and the Navy Museum.",
11061,"I also like going to concert halls, theaters, and the Philharmonic Hall.",
11062,-,
11063,When did you become so interested in Russian culture?,
11064,-,
11065,"When I was a preparatory student here, I read a lot and watched a lot of movies.",
11066,"When I went to museums, I always talked to museum curators - it was very interesting to talk to them, they knew so much!",
11067,"They tell me things that you cant find in books., - Speaking of books, you probably have a favorite Russian writer, don’t you?",
11068,- It’s hard to choose.,
11069,"Chekhov, Tolstoy, Pushkin...",
11070,I probably can’t do without Chekhov’s stories.,
11071,-,
11072,And what about films?,
11073,- I like Soviet cinematography.,
11074,"“The Big Break”, “Office Romance”, “A Station for Two” are my favorite films.",
11075,"I watch movies with military themes, such as “Officers. -",
11076,"Surely in those 10 years, you have traveled a lot all over Russia.",
11077,Can you tell us which places you remember most of all?,
11078,Where would you like to visit?,
11079,-,
11080,"When I was studying astronomy at university, we had two internships in the south in the mountains.",
11081,"We lived in Kislovodsk and then, a year later, in Nizhny Arkhyz.",
11082,"Then we also visited Pyatigorsk, Essentuki, Mineralnye Vody, and Cherkessk.",
11083,Not far from Nizhny Arkhyz the largest telescope in Russia is located.,
11084,"At one time I visited Yekaterinburg, Yaroslavl, Moscow, Obninsk, and Saransk.",
11085,"I dream to visit Baikal and Kamchatka, and of course, the Crimea.",
11086,-,
11087,"In one of the webinars for Arab applicants in which you participated, you talked about safety.",
11088,What should prospective students know?,
11089,-,
11090,"Sometimes it’s not enough to just say, “Be careful.”",
11091,It needs to be repeated many times and given concrete examples.,
11092,"You should not walk through unlit streets at night; it is important to keep a close eye on your valuables, and it is also important to be conscious of your documents.",
11093,"For example, I once went to Lebanon in winter, came back to Russia, and a few months later, when I came to renew my visa, I was shocked to learn that I had not renewed my registration, so I was living in Russia illegally.",
11094,And that I urgently needed to fly to Lebanon.,
11095,"Because of this situation, I could not get access to examinations.",
11096,"To avoid such cases, keep a close eye on the validity of your documents.",
11097,"- We often ask foreign scholars, professors, and students for advice for those who are just about to come to Russia to study or work.",
11098,What would you advise?,
11099,"- First, prepare well for your trip.",
11100,"Read more information about Russia, read Russian literature and cinematography, explore the websites of universities, and ask your friends who have studied or are still studying in Russia.",
11101,It’s important to hear the opinions of both because life changes very quickly.,
11102,"If I had come to Lebanon in 2016, I would not have been able to tell you about Russia what I know now.",
11103,"If you don’t have such acquaintances, visit the relevant groups on social networks - there are plenty of them on the Internet.",
11104,"Secondly, study well and don’t skip classes.",
11105,"Make sure you communicate with Russian people, go to museums, theaters, and cultural centers more often.",
11106,"- Hussein, thank you for the interesting interview!",
11107,"We wish you success and good luck!

11116,"You might be surprised, but these works are pretty popular in China!",
11117,And after school I decided to go on my big trip to Russia.,
11118,"Polytechnic University attracted me with its stunning main building: it is just like in the books that the parents read to me in my childhood, a real palace it was!",

11130,I am surprised when they say that in Russia people are strict and unresponsive.,
11131,I have not encountered anything of the kind during my stay in St. Petersburg.,
11132,"I like a busy extra-curricular life, clubs, competitions, excursion; this is also a merit of Polytechnic University.",

11170,"For convenience, the clinic management recommends that you come in groups with an even number of people, because vaccine vials contain two doses of the drug and it is faster to vaccinate in pairs.",
11171,", We met with international students at Polytechnic University who have recently been inoculated against coronavirus and learned what motivated their decisions.",
11172,Vikas KUMAR (India) is a Master’s degree student at the Institute of Physics and Mechanics and studies continuum mechanics.,

11177,"I also recommend it to other international students, not so much for the certificate, but for your safety.",
11178,And I also want to draw your attention to the fact that after vaccination you may have a fever and a temporary worsening of your well-being.,

11184,"Secondly, when I was in Moscow, I couldn’t go to the embassy without a QR code.",
11185,They don’t let you into many places without one there.,
11186,Would I recommend vaccination to other students?,
11187,"Yes, of course.",

11189,"We all want to be able to walk the streets safely, to meet up with friends.",
11190,"And for that, we need to be healthy.",
11191,So I do recommend other students to get vaccinated.,
11192,", The vaccination process itself was very quick.",
11193,I went to the health clinic.,
11194,"There was a line, but it moved quickly.",
11195,"There are two doses of the vaccine in each vial, so it was better to come in two.",
11196,Other students also helped me fill out the form.,
11197,"We promptly handle incoming requests from international students, and we also involved tutors from the international student organization ‘TutorForces’ in the case: if necessary, they help foreigners fill out questionnaires, commented Pavel NEDELKO, Deputy Director of the Higher School of International Educational Programs.

11230,New Years tree in the hall cheered everyone up.,
11231,"It is very well known that the main symbol of a New Year should not be decorated all by oneself, so everyone interested joined the decoration process.",

11233,"Shine, New Year tree!",
11234,and beautiful lights began to sparkle.,
11235,"Everybody found an attraction after his or her own heart: people were dancing, singing, cutting out paper snowflakes, or joined a cooking workshop., \We\ll cook a lot of traditional Russian salad Olivie - everyone will try it!\ - says tutor Ivan Ugrjumov.",
11236,"What is interesting, some students knew other traditional salads of Russia - for example, Christiane Licht (Germany) told that she liked dressed herring, and also knew how to cook it.",

11238,"Its great that we have such events, which help us learn more about culture of another country.",

11265,"After this eventful day I understand even more how diverse our world is and how many interesting things there are in it, shared Govshut Perniyazov, a student of SPbPU from Turkmenistan.
",
11266,"I speak English well, but I want to improve my Russian, confessed Ogul UNAL and insisted that the interview be conducted in Russian.",
11267,A determined young man came to St. Petersburg from Turkey two years ago.,
11268,"He decided that he wanted to study in Russia and as a result, he completed his Master’s degree program at Polytechnic University - at the Institute of Computer Science and Technology.",
11269,Now he is studying under the postgraduate study program.,
11270,"Ogul is not only a talented young scientist, but also a teacher of the International Polytechnic Summer Schoolthe students love.",
11271,His leisure time he dedicates to playing the guitar.,
11272,Ogul understood that it is impossible to live in Russia without knowing Russian.,
11273,And his own secret in learning the language is not to be afraid to make mistakes and work on them.,
11274,"Although he sometimes misses his home, he still loves St. Petersburg and is proud to have connected his life with Polytechnic University.",
11275,"- Ogul, why did you need to go to study abroad??",
11276,-,
11277,"In the town of Chivril, where I was born, live less than 20 thousand people.",
11278,"I always wanted to go to a big city, so I chose a university in Istanbul and studied at the Department of Computer Engineering.",
11279,"Already when I started working in my profession, I wanted to learn some other language.",
11280,"I knew German at a basic level, but I did not want to continue learning it.",
11281,I chose Russian because I heard a lot of Russian speech around me and I liked the way it sounded.,
11282,"At first, back in Istanbul, I took a nine-month Russian course.",
11283,After that I decided to apply for the Master’s degree already in Russia.,
11284,"Before that I had been to St. Petersburg, and I liked the city very much.",
11285,"It turned out that Polytechnic University had a program on “Intellectual Systems,” and I was interested in exactly this sphere, where there is artificial intelligence, machine learning, control systems, and much more.",
11286,"When I was 27, I enrolled in the Master’s program of Polytechnic University, and after graduating from it, I was advised to go to the post-graduate course too.",
11287,-,
11288,And you decided to stay.,
11289,"You probably found a job, didn’t you?",
11290,"- I have an interesting job in the field of search engine optimization, which brings me a pretty good income.",
11291,"In addition, I am engaged in important scientific research, and I teach at Polytechnic University - I like it.",
11292,"But I am very afraid of the philosophy exam, which will take place literally in a week.",
11293,I’m worried about this right now!,
11294,-,
11295,And why exactly does this subject scare you?,
11296,"- I believe that philosophy is a very important subject that shapes the outlook on life, teaches us to understand science and the structure of the world in general.",
11297,"Although I love philosophy, it is still difficult for me to explain my thoughts in Russian.",
11298,"So it sometimes seems - almost like Socrates, that I only know that I dont know anything ...",
11299,"And the exam will also be full-time, from which during the pandemic we have all lost the habit., -",
11300,"At the very beginning, when you came to Russia, was it difficult for you to be here?",
11301,-,
11302,"If we talk about studying, yes, it was a bit difficult.",
11303,"But I liked the fact that I had to work a lot, do my homework - thanks to this I was able to understand even pretty difficult subjects.",
11304,"As for the language, I read many books by Russian authors - Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov and others.",
11305,"I really like Russian culture, Russian soul - it was interesting to learn that, both through books and live.",
11306,"The most difficult moments for me are when I miss the live communication with my relatives and friends, not through video communication.",
11307,"And I miss our national cuisine, but I got used to local food long ago.",
11308,I dream to go home on vacation for at least 10 days.,
11309,- What do you like most about St. Petersburg?,
11310,- It seems to me like a special city.,
11311,"Although a little depressing, it is largely due to the cloudy weather.",
11312,"But compared to the same Istanbul, it is a safe city.",
11313,It is tranquil and nice here.,
11314,"I love Rubinstein Street - it is very atmospheric, there are a lot of people there, it is some kind of special energy.",
11315,I also like Nevsky Avenue with its beautiful views.,
11316,"I also admire the Polytechnic University campus: it is stylish; it comprises modern buildings, ancient buildings, and even a park.",
11317,"If my guests came to visit me, I would definitely show them Polytechnic University!",
11318,"- Tell us about your scientific interests, please.",
11319,"- Machine learning is a discipline within a whole line of studies, which is called artificial intelligence.",
11320,"We teach the model to solve the problem of classification of objects, and it is useful in many areas.",
11321,"For example, my master\s degree work was related to obtaining brain signals and using them to recognize actions - this process is called electroencephalography.",
11322,"The point is that you control the robot by just thinking about it and doing nothing else, that is, by the power of thought.",
11323,"For example, you decided: Go left!",
11324,or I want to go up and the robot did it.,
11325,"This is useful for disabled people, for example.",
11326,"I never dreamed of becoming a doctor, but I like to help others and make their lives easier through machine learning.",
11327,- What do you teach at Polytechnic University?,
11328,-,
11329,This year I taught machine training during the International Polytechnic Summer School.,
11330,"Due to the pandemic and closed borders, the school had to use online format for the first time ever, but everything went perfectly.",
11331,Even television came to shoot us.,
11332,Over 300 people from 27 countries participated in the summer school.,
11333,"These are really concerned students, they all did their homework and coped with the final project, for which they worked with a real database.",
11334,"I like to teach because I not only give some information to students, but also learn something new.",
11335,I try to explain in class how I can effectively use the knowledge I receive.,
11336,"I feel that students are quite interested, so I like to teach.",
11337,"Now I want to lead classes not only in the short-term program, but also during the academic year.",
11338,"- Ogul, for sure you have helpful advice for international students applying to Russian universities.",
11339,"- First of all, it is impossible to live here without knowing the Russian language.",
11340,"Second, be ready to live by yourself and alone for a while.",
11341,You will need to adapt to Russian people.,
11342,"To be more exact, the Russians need time to adapt to you.",
11343,"I noticed that they are quite restrained, even chilly at the beginning of communication.",
11344,"But after a while, they become a lot more open and allow you to communicate with them closer: it takes patience to reach this level when the St. Petersburg people “thaw.”",
11345,"This is not bad or good, I just wanted to share what I have noticed in my experience.",
11346,I am becoming more restrained here myself; at home they even ask why I have become like this.,
11347,"In reality, everything is fine - I just live in the Northern Capital of Russia.",
11348,I also recommend that international students visit all museums.,
11349,"St. Petersburg has a soul, and it is impossible to perceive it without visiting museums and without seeing the main attractions.",
11350,Be sure to study this city: it is beautiful!,
11351,"- Ogul, thank you so much for the interesting conversation.",
11352,"Have a successful philosophy exam and an interesting academic year!

11358,"And indeed, Tsar Peter was, in many ways, the first.",
11359,"His large-scale transformations concerned all spheres of public life in the Russian Empire: the tsar laid the foundations of the modern state structure of Russia, created a regular army and navy, established a new system of education.",
11360,To add new and important strokes to the portrait of Peter the Great is the purpose of the special project Petro Primo.,
11361,"Among the many interesting facts about the monarch-reformer, one of the most curious is why our university is named after Peter the Great since it was founded almost two centuries after the emperor’s death?",
11362,We will tell you about it in the first issue.,
11363,"On September 30, 1909 (the 10th anniversary year), the Saint Petersburg Polytechnic Institute’s Council decided to petition Emperor Nicholas II for the Institute to be named after Peter the Great.",
11364,"On October 16, 1909, the director of the Institute, Prince Alexei Gagarin, on behalf of the Council of the Institute addressed to the Educational Department of the Ministry: «On September 30, 1909, the Board recognized it to be especially desirable that the name of the St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute be connected with the name of EMPEROR PETER THE GREAT, since, on the one hand, the Institute contains branches corresponding to the fields of knowledge in which the Great Russian Reformer demonstrated his genius gifts, and on the other hand, there is not yet a single institution of higher education, which would bear the name of the Great Emperor»",
11365,"(Source: RGIA, f. 25, op. 1, d. 5866, pp. 41-45).",
11366,"On January 19, 1910, Emperor Nicholas II signed a Decree «On naming the Institute «Emperor Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute».",
11367,"On January 20, the Board of the Institute received from Minister S. I. Timashev the following text: «On 19th January the Emperorperor deigns, upon my report of the petition of the Council of St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute about awarding the institute with the name: „Emperor Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute“, to satisfy this petition.",
11368,I congratulate the council of the institute with this gracious permission and express my hope that the institute will be worthy of the name it will henceforth bear.,
11369,"S. Timashev» (Source: RSHA, f. 25, op. 1, d. 5869",
11370,p. 3).,
11371,"The Institute bore this name until 1918: until the People’s Commissariat for Education abolished diplomas and certificates, ranks, titles, and degrees (the Professorial Council of the Institute was to be dissolved, departments in institutes were renamed faculties, the director became rector).",
11372,"On July 5, 1918, the institute became known as the First Petrograd Polytechnic Institute.",
11373,"On February 12, 2015, by Order № 88 of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, our university was returned to its historical name «Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University».

11396,"The teams had to decide in which direction to develop the company’s business, based on the available resources and market trends, as well as to suggest a strategy and elaborate an action plan for its realization.",
11397,"As a result of their work, the teams presented their projects to the international jury, which consisted of representatives of Russian universities, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, Embassy of the Netherlands in Moscow, and Deloitte.",
11398,"According to the decision of the jury, five teams made it to the final.",

11441,"I started to be more attentive to different cultures, to study their features, to pay attention even to the smallest details.",
11442,"— And in general, do you think there is a tendency in Egypt to go to study abroad?",

11447,"— You study in English, tell me, how is your Russian?",
11448,— I started learning Russian back in Egypt.,
11449,"But when I came to Russia, I realized how rich and complicated it is.",
11450,"Much harder than English, by the way.",
11451,"In the first weeks, I didn’t understand a word of Russian.",
11452,The language barrier was a big problem for me.,
11453,"After a few months I began to understand what people were saying, but I still couldn’t answer.",

11455,— Is it easy for you to study at Polytechnic University?,
11456,"— I won’t say it’s easy, but it’s not hard either.",

11477,"— Tell us, what are your plans for the future?",
11478,"— At the moment, I am considering two options — to work in marketing, or to start my own business.",

11613,Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University became the first Russian university to implement a balanced plant-based menu that meets the nutritional needs of all students and reduces the carbon footprint.,
11614,"St. Petersburg Polytechnic University signed an agreement on September 27th to implement a completely plant-based menu, supporting the «Food for the Mind» project implemented by the «Voices for Animals» non-governmental organization in cooperation with the Green Universities of Russia Association and the Healthy Nutrition Research Center.",
11615,"At Polytechnic University, the initiative was implemented thanks to the active work of the student environmental association ReGreen and the students’ trade union organization.",
11616,"We gladly supported the initiative of the student environmental association ReGreen and thanks to the team of the project ‘Food for the Mind’ with the participation of chef Arturas Vaičius, we are the first in Russia to introduce a plant-based menu in the canteens of Polytechnic University.",
11617,"The development of the social and living environment in the university is the main function of our management, and we strive to organize a comfortable environment for gaining knowledge.",
11618,"The future belongs to those who choose an active lifestyle and wholesome healthy meals, believes Zarina NAUMOVA, Head of the Social and Welfare and Logistics Department of SPbPU.",
11619,"Minestrone, Finnish soup, spinach cream soup, borscht or Indian dal, rice with chickpeas and curry, bulgur with mushrooms, or green mashed potatoes with sausage.",
11620,"Ten options for set lunches, five different bowls, hot snacks, and baked goods of all kinds.",
11621,All of this is plant-based and will now be available to students and faculty at Polytechnic.,
11622,"This should please those who, for one reason or another, do not consume animal products, including people with lactose intolerance, vegetarians, and vegans.",
11623,"Experienced chefs, technologists, and medical experts worked on the menu.",
11624,"According to experts, a balanced vegetable diet reduces the risk of arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and cancer.",
11625,"And the introduction of such a menu meets the goals of sustainable development of the UN and the Paris agreement on climate change because it reduces the rate of livestock production, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions.",
11626,"According to calculations by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), this industry accounts for 14.5% of emissions.",
11627,"Interestingly, Cambridge University’s catering service replaced red meat with plant-based products four years ago to reduce carbon emissions from the food purchased by the university.",
11628,Today more than a third of UK universities have opened specialized vegetarian and vegan cafés.,
11629,Other countries are following the same path.,
11630,"The launch of Green Meals at Polytechnic University is a great example of how a student at our university can dream of introducing a balanced plant-based meal in the dining halls, but also through student government to implement such an initiative from the ground up.",
11631,Special thanks to the Office of Social Welfare and Logistics for coming to our aid.,
11632,"Cases like this show that any of us can make our university better, says Nikita CHUBUR, chairman of the trade union organization of students at SPbPU.",
11633,"Anna ZIV, coordinator of the Food for the Mind project, is convinced that plant-based options on the menu are not only a big step towards the greening of the university but also an indicator of the university’s open position that gives students and faculty a choice: Every visitor to the canteen will be able to make an informed choice by familiarizing themselves with information on the composition of dishes, their nutritional value, the impact of food production on the environment.",
11634,"It is important to note that due to the introduction of plant-based options, the range is expanding.",
11635,"That is, those who want to buy a meat cutlet will still have that option, but now they can try a chickpea cutlet or other plant-based protein products that are just as tasty and nutritious as animal products.",
11636,I truly believe that students and faculty will be more likely to choose plant-based alternatives and that other universities will pick up the baton from Polytechnic University.,
11637,"«Food for the Mind» is a nonprofit project of Voices for Animals, an NGO.",
11638,"Project specialists help universities incorporate plant-based menus into canteens step by step, providing full informational support.",
11639,"If necessary, they hold training workshops with menu authors and nutrition experts, as well as other events that introduce students to the topic of the impact of diet on the environment and human health.",
11640,All services are free for universities.,
11641,Other institutions of higher education in the country can also implement the menu.,
11642,"Step-by-step instructions on how to do this can be found on the project website foodft.ru.

11645,"International students from all over the world made short videos with New Year’s wishes, where, according to the script, they caught and passed a Christmas tree ornament behind the frame, which symbolized the connection between countries and continents.",
11646,"This year, the idea for the New Year video was magical transformations.",
11647,"The main character was Harun TOKSHEN, a student of SPbPU from Turkey.",
11648,"According to the script, he found a Santa Claus hat in the park of Polytechnic University and became a magician himself for a while.",
11649,"Everyone who greeted Santa — and these were Polytechnic students from Turkey, Guinea, and Russia, as well as Admission Office managers — received a New Year’s transformation.",
11650,"Miracles happen, the main thing is to believe in them!",
11651,"said Harun TOKSHEN, who looked very harmonious in the image of the New Year wizard.",
11652,The students of the Higher School of Media Communications and Public Relations took part in the shooting and editing of the holiday video.,
11653,"They carried out this project as part of an internship in the International office of SPbPU.
",
11654,"Dear partners, friends and colleagues!",
11655,Dear students!,
11656,On behalf of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!,
11657,We wish all the students to successfully pass your exams and have great winter holidays!,

11663,"Every New Year gives us new opportunities, new ideas and new journeys!",
11664,Dear friends!,
11665,We wish you a joyous holiday season and a New Year filled with peace and happiness!,
11666,"Sincerely yours,
",
11667,What an employer is looking for in a CV of a young specialist?,
11668,"Of course, his or her work experience!",
11669,"But if you have not had it yet, participation in various case competitions would be a great opportunity to gain invaluable experience.",
11670,One of them is a programming and analytics competition in the field of financial technology and banking FinTech Cup 2017.,
11671,FinTech are technologic projects in the field of financial services.,
11672,Nowadays FinTech is considered to be one of the most advanced and in-demand ways for startups.,
11673,About 400 participants came to the final contest which was held in Moscow in the middle of July.,
11674,"While their friends enjoyed a worry-free time playing video games and watching series, they immersed themselves in the world of FinTech and met the representatives of the leading companies.",
11675,"The participants were the students and PhD students from all over Russia who took interest in programming, business analytics and financial technology; had a nose for business or would like to develop this skill; believed in a better tomorrow with Internet of things and highly developed payment technology.",
11676,"‘Case competition allows people who have not had work experience yet show their capacities, - says Alexey Blagirev, Bank Otkritie director of innovations, - I share the opinion that the business model of FinTech development will be the driver of digital economics, that is why it is important to create a platform where young people will be heard by the major competitors and will have a feedback.",
11677,Under the competition the partner companies expect to see many prospective students.,
11678,They are interested in bringing them into the fold’.,
11679,The expert jury chose 28 teams; all of them came through to the finals.,
11680,"The runner-ups not only mastered their skills, worked with real business targets and gained knowledge from mentors, but also could find the future employers and the partners for their projects, test their business solutions on the real audience of the competition partners.",
11681,"The competition was held in two categories: business analytics (development and market integration of a new product concept) and financial technology software programming (creation of mobile apps: messengers, chat-bots, and speech recognition services).",
11682,Among the finalists were Polytechnic students Vladislav Kaluga and Arseniy Bondarev who presented the team ‘Peter’s Thunder’ .,
11683,The team was first in the business analytics section.,
11684,Under the competition it had to create the concept of p2p product (transfer from card to card) for QIWI Company.,
11685,"Polytechnic students succeeded in the task thanks to the knowledge they gained at the Graduate School of Industrial Management and Economics of the Institute of Industrial Management, Economics and Trade (IIMET SPbPU).",
11686,"According to the head of the QIWI investment department Olga Turzhansky, the team ‘differentiated itself from others with the deep-laid concept and understanding of the customer needs’.",
11687,"Vladislav Kaluga noted that participation in the competition was not as easy as they expected, and the team won because every teammate clearly understood his or her tasks.",
11688,"‘FinTech was a good test for us to check our ability to solve business targets quickly, - added Arseniy Bondarev, - p2p market analysis showed that there are many market windows in Russia which can be effectively used by the major competitors’.",
11689,"Now the best teams are able to undergo training at partner companies, and CVs of each teammate have been sent to their HR Departments.",
11690,"In conclusion Olga Turzhansky professed that it has been really hard for the jury to define the winners of the competition, because all teams have coped with the business cases in a perfect way.",
11691,‘We are very pleased with the results.,
11692,The competition was really huge and useful from the point of view of development of new generation of entrepreneurships.,
11693,"We have plans to continue our cooperation as with the winners of our competitions, as with the other teams and participants’.
",
11694,"International students of Polytechnic University and other city universities celebrated the spring equinox Novruz at the PolyUnion interclub, which operates at the Higher School of International Educational Programs (HS IEP) of SPbPU.",
11695,It was organized by the residents of the inter-club and the Vasileostrovsky Youth Center.,
11696,"At the beginning of the event, Pavel Nedelko, assistant vice-rector for international affairs at SPbPU, Lilia Tovmasyan, youth specialist at Vasileostrovsky District Youth Center, and Polina Yushkevich, the new head of PolyUnion, greeted the participants.",
11697,Then came the concert part of the program.,
11698,"Foreign students prepared creative numbers, which reflected the cultural characteristics of their peoples.",
11699,"Students from Uzbekistan played traditional musical instruments, and students from Afghanistan performed national dances.",
11700,Turkmenistan’s,
11701,"Guzel Afganova performed a song in Turkmen, while Tajikistan’s John Soliyev recited a poem in Tajik about sumalak, a holiday dish of Iranian and Turkic peoples.",
11702,Students from Kazakhstan concluded the program with a song in Kazakh.,
11703,"After the concert, everyone who wished went to taste traditional national treats.",
11704,"This year, they were prepared by children from Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.",
11705,"Guests of the festival were able to try baursak, dograma, manty, kuyman, chak-chak, as well as pilaf, which was the main dish of the evening.",
11706,The celebration ended with an ethno-disco.,
11707,The guests of the holiday got acquainted with the cultural and national features of the countries where Navruz is celebrated — they tasted traditional dishes and watched performances of students from all over the world.,
11708,"Everyone fully embraced the atmosphere, said Govshut Perniyazov, leader of the Turkmen community of St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.",
11709,"We had a lot of fun at this festival and met new people from Kazakhstan, Iran, Azerbaijan and other countries.",
11710,"They told us a lot of interesting things about Nowruz and how it is celebrated in different countries, said Mohamed Alfakeh, a Polytechnic student from Afghanistan, and we heartily thank the organizers of this event.",
11711,"I would also like to add that such festivals are a great opportunity to develop our knowledge about other cultures and get to know people from different countries.
",
11712,"At the end of June Director of Institute of Experimental Physics (Graz University of Technology, Austria) professor Wolfgang E. Ernst gave a lecture Molecular Dynamics and Cluster Formation in Superfluid Helium Droplets for SPbPU students.",
11713,"Then we interviewed Professor Ernst and he told us about his scholarly endeavor, efficient teaching approaches, gave an opinion about the trends of the modern higher educational system and also entrusted with a secret about self-motivation and why it is important to motivate students to study., - Is this your first visit to St. Petersburg?",
11714,-,
11715,"Yes, its my first visit.",
11716,St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.,
11717,"This combination of water, and architecture, and then the sun of sunlight...",
11718,It is just gorgeous!,
11719,I think I took more than a hundred pictures.,
11720,"Ill definitely come back!, - Here at SPbPU you gave a lecture ‘Molecular Dynamics and Cluster Formation in Superfluid Helium Droplets’ for our students.",
11721,Could you explain our readers in simple words what your lecture is about?,
11722,"– There is now interest at first in basic research, but then it will go into technology to explore more and more very small fractions of material which you build up from an individual atom.",
11723,"So you put together atom by atom, and then you try to see, if it has properties that are different from what you are used to have in everyday life.",
11724,"Properties I mean like electric properties, magnetic properties, etc.",
11725,And this is an area where you have a chance from materials which are not very expensive build new samples which can perhaps replace something which is expensive to handle.,
11726,", For example, in Chemistry when you use catalyzers to do catalytic reaction, then it is nowadays still done with very expensive materials, with platinum, palladium or so on.",
11727,"And if you can find replacements by building new structures from cheaper type, then this would be an economic advantage, so anyway in the long term basic research will hopefully turn into economic advantage.",
11728,- You told us about everyday life.,
11729,And are there any examples of practical use of these researches in everyday life?,
11730,-,
11731,"For example, petroleum industry.",
11732,Catalytic reactions which Ive already mentioned are an essential part of petroleum processing.,
11733,"Normally the materials used for these catalytic processes are that expensive, so researchers try to look into cheaper ones.",
11734,One of my former students was involved in a project which is around the same topics which I talked about.,
11735,"It was funded by a big petroleum industry, it was a grant given to a university by British Petroleum (BP), and he explored theoretically how more efficient a platinum converter could be if its all set up by small, very small platinum clusters., - Speaking about students, how long have you been working as a professor?",
11736,- More than 34 years.,
11737,"During this time I worked in West Berlin, then in 1990 I got the position in the USA, so I had worked there for 12 years at the Pennsylvania State University; and then in 2002 I have started working at Graz University of Technology.",
11738,"Here I had 16 students who finished PhD with me, and this is the largest group of doctoral students Ive ever had.",
11739,"Right now I have 5 students working on the PhD with me.,",
11740,-,
11741,What teaching approaches do you consider to be the most efficient?,
11742,-,
11743,"Well, it depends, of course, on the year during the education.",
11744,"I prefer working with small groups of students, but in the very beginning of a bachelor’s program it is almost impossible.",
11745,"But then in the master’s program I can work with 15 students in the class, and that is better, especially when they start working on their master theses.",
11746,Then we have everyday contacts.,
11747,My office door is always open.,
11748,This is the thing Ive learnt in the USA.,
11749,"It is good when professors can easily be approached, so students come to the open door, knock and then you talk with them.,",
11750,"- What do you think, what is an appropriate amount of students in a group?",
11751,- This is an important question.,
11752,"Now I have 2 young assistant professors that are still working with me, and so together we are 18, which is getting a bit large.",
11753,So I would agree with one famous Noble prize winner at Stanford whom I talked to many years ago.,
11754,He said: Nine students in my group – this is what I can handle well and I fully agree.,
11755,"Something below ten, so you can have really intensive contacts.",
11756,"When one of them comes with a question, you can spend an hour on talking.",
11757,"When its more, then it becomes more difficult.",
11758,"Once a week on Fridays we have a big meeting, and everyone tells what he has done during the week.",
11759,"When the problems come up, then the others hear that – if they have not heard that before – and then they can help each other.",
11760,"Its a very good experience., -",
11761,"And what do you think, what are the modern trends in the higher education?",
11762,- I think this is still something which has not been really resolved.,
11763,"There is the constant evaluation of programs, and according to the international statistics, now many people in each group have an academic education.",
11764,And now the question is: should everybody have an academic education?,
11765,"There can be different opinions, because we have a tendency to raise that portion, but partly it is caused by the quality of the education, because more and more students are there, and you cannot interact with them, so you just try to push them through the system.",
11766,And I am not sure if that is a good development.,
11767,In many countries we observe that very few people know one of the traditional professions – craftsmanship or so.,
11768,And I have probably bigger sympathy to somebody who is an excellent craftsman rather than being a bad scientist.,
11769,"Unfortunately, there is no yet a clear solution now.",
11770,-,
11771,Maybe you can find any positive trends?,
11772,- Sure.,
11773,It’s about the technologies especially when it comes to interface with computers and analyzing data...,
11774,All this requires more people knowledgeable in this area.,
11775,"So this is something which we probably achieve in a better way than in former times, and of course that has to continue.",
11776,-,
11777,And what about e-learning?,
11778,- It requires a lot of discipline on the side of the people who learn.,
11779,"I observe that with all the Internet materials which are there on my course, people do think that they dont have to come to the lecture.",
11780,And the problem is that a week before their exam they start to learn and this is too short.,
11781,Pure e-learning is not being a success.,
11782,"It is an addition, that can be complimentary, but at least at the higher level you need personal interaction.",
11783,"It can work only when a student is able to organize his or her time in such a matter to spend some hours a day on his or her studying., - Do you think the professors should motivate the students to study? -",
11784,Of course they should.,
11785,"You have to ask interesting questions, you have to relate with examples from everyday life.",
11786,There are really few who are self-motivated.,
11787,This has always been in history.,
11788,"Students, maybe one in a million, learnt through the encyclopedias, and did all in their own.",
11789,But this is not a normal case.,
11790,"I think, my parents motivated me even before school, and I think it has to continue through all your life.",
11791,"Even we, professors, should be motivated sometimes!",
11792,- What can you advice our students to be motivated?,
11793,"- First of all, the matter which you study yourself.",
11794,"This is partly the self-motivation, because you want to know more deeply what is behind, what is around you.",
11795,"So in science (and nature science especially) when you see something happening, you start to think why is it happening?",
11796,It can be compared with a small kid who is about to learn speaking.,
11797,"He moves around in the room and explores things, then there is a desire to explore the environment.",
11798,"Then, of course, one other thing is to shift the borderlines how far your understanding goes, so that you keep ask questions and not stop when youll have got the explanations.",
11799,This is what drives you ahead.,
11800,"Youve got some explanations, but you realize this is not deep enough, because it does not connected to other explanations perhaps.",
11801,"So this is all where you can get your motivation from., – Professor Ernst, thank you very much for the interesting interview!",
11802,"We wish you good luck in your pedagogical and scholarly endeavors!
",
11803,"In the beginning of July, 2017 Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University held IV All-Russian School for Young Scientists.",
11804,25 students and PhD students from eight Russian universities became the participants of the event through a competitive selection process.,
11805,"Their projects were aimed at research of new materials and fields of their application, and using additive technologies in metallurgy.",
11806,I decided to submit an application when I saw the program content.,
11807,"I was very interested in opportunity not only to present my project but also to gain experience and knowledge in businesses’, – told Andrew Schelkunov, masters degree student from Yuri Gagarin State Technical University of Saratov., The opening ceremony of the Young Scientists School was held at the Research and Innovation Complex Nanobiotechnologies under the plenary meeting of the XII International Research and Technology Conference Modern Metal Materials and Constructions where the participants learnt a lot of new information about trends of modern science from the leading scientists: Head of Laboratory of Materials Science, Institute of Solid State Physics RAS Mikhail I.Karpov, Director of Institute of Metallurgy, Mechanical Engineering and Transport Anatoliy A. Popovich, Director of CRISM Prometey Aleksey S. Oryshchenko, RAS corresponding member R.R. Mulyukov, etc., After the end of the plenary meeting Deputy Director of Engineering Center Center for Computer Engineering (CompMechLab®)",
11808,"Eugene V. Belosludtsev told the young scientists about the TechNet (National Technology Initiative) working group activity, made a point of importance of transition from traditional industry to advanced industry and shared successful experience of Polytechnic University in implementation of the project Factories of the Future.",
11809,"Also the participants visited the leading scientific laboratories of SPbPU, completed with the latest technical equipment: Laboratory of Study and Modeling of the Structure and Properties of Metals, Laboratory of Lightweight Materials and Structures and the Supercomputer Center Polytechnic.",
11810,Then the students had a varied business and educational program on shipboard ‘Vissarion Belinsky’.,
11811,", Next day experts from SPbPU said the students about youth innovative projects support programs.",
11812,The Director of Intellectual Property Center I.G. Kadiev told them about possible grant from the Foundation for Assistance to Small Innovative Enterprises in Science and Technology (FASIE) for various upstarts.,
11813,Many participants were interested in the ‘UMNIK’ (rus.,
11814,for a clever person): the program which is aimed for upstarts oriented on National Technology initiative.,
11815,"And if many participants have heard about FASIE, just few students knew about pre-accelerator and accelerator ‘GenerationS’.",
11816,"The Director of business incubator ‘Polytechnic’ O.I. Borscheva explained in her presentation why the participation in such programs is important, and told about fast upstarts with the next entry into a global market, using the examples of successful SPbPU experience.",
11817,"After that the students met with SPbPU scientist, Rector Advisor, Professor V.V. Korablev, who told them about the main technological trends and shared his experience in international cooperation with China.",
11818,The third day of the School was dedicated to the creation of business concept innovation project.,
11819,"The Director of Polytech Strascheg Russian-German Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship A.M. Efimov spoke about the meaning of value proposition, work with competitors, market analysis, etc.",
11820,Finally the students strengthened their knowledge with a business game.,
11821,"During the fourth day of the School the participants made their final presentations of the projects, which they presented the jury.",
11822,"The jury consisted of SPbPU Professor V.V. Korablev, the Head of the department of Materials Research and Technology V.N. Tsemenko, sales manager of Moscow representative office ‘Intertech Corporation’ E. Starobinskaya.",
11823,‘I didn’t expect it would be so interesting.,
11824,All the things the speakers said I will use in my project.,
11825,"In the nearest future I am going to use the knowledge I’ve got here in the third part of mydissertation, where it is necessary to describe internal development.",
11826,"Also I think to apply for START program or some other grant’, – shared her impressions PhD student from Yuri Gagarin State Technical University of Saratov O. Tischenko.
",
11827,"Activists of the environmental association ReGreen, in cooperation with SPbPU authorities have developed a project for a separate waste collection system on the territory of the university.",
11828,Special containers are already installed near the buildings.,
11829,Just think: each of us annually produces about 400 kg of waste.,
11830,"This is 40 million tons of garbage throughout Russia, 93% of which is brought away to landfills.",
11831,Separate waste collection system allows processing up to 90% of waste.,
11832,"In this case, almost all waste becomes secondary raw materials, which can be used more than once for the new products.",
11833,"Sorting and recycling eliminates waste incineration and pyrolysis, which poison nature and people, so this system reduces the impact on the environment, reduces harmful emissions and restores the natural system.",
11834,"In our country there are already processing enterprises, however they are not working to the full extent.",
11835,"The project was proposed by students of the environmental association ReGreen and, of course, found support from the administrative and economic services of the Polytechnic University and personally from the Vice Rector for General Services Mikhail GREKOV.",
11836,"Activists are confident that the introduction of separate waste collection on the territory of the university is a huge step in the development of environmental awareness among young people, rational waste management, responsible consumption and production.",
11837,"This has a positive effect on our lifestyle: we begin to adequately evaluate our expenses, become less prone to spontaneous purchases, save money on what we really don’t need, we clearly see what we are buying, and how much is spent on packaging.",
11838,"As for the university, the introduction of separate collection allows you to save significant money on garbage collection.",
11839,"From the agreement, posted in open sources, we can see that about 8 million rubles have already been saved.",
11840,"“For the first time, a stationary separate waste collection system has been launched at the overall university,” according to one of the initiators of the project, a student of the Institute of Civil Engineering Elizaveta Khrapkina.",
11841,"- In many universities there are initiatives to install containers, but the territory of the Polytechnic University is like a small city, and it was required to offer a system solution.",
11842,Sorting along with the usual export scheme has already been fixed in the main university document on waste management.”,
11843,"Since February 2020, 15% of waste, namely waste paper and plastic (bottles labelled 1 - PET), are to be recycled.",
11844,Blue and orange metal nets are placed on each container site of the university.,
11845,"Such points are especially relevant on the territory of dorms, since the campus is the place of the greatest accumulation of municipal solid waste.",
11846,The first litter bins are also installed in the administrative premises Civil Engineering Institute Building.,
11847,This was made possible thanks to ReGreen team winning the grant competition of the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs (Rosmolodezh).,
11848,"In the future, other buildings will be equipped with special containers for sorting litter.",
11849,"“Next time taking away litter take bottles and paper to give them a second life,” the guys from ReGreen appeal to all polytechnics.",
11850,“And then it’s our turn!”,
11851,"Simple instructions on the rules for using the separate waste collection system are available on stands in educational buildings, in the campus and in the ReGreen Vkontakte group.",
11852,"For example, paper, cardboard, magazines can be returned to waste paper containers.",
11853,"But receipts, “paper” cups, dirty and greasy waste paper are prohibited, because they can spoil the overall separately collected waste.",
11854,Rinse and squeeze plastic bottles before recycling.,
11855,Bottles with covers and labels are allowed.,
11856,You can also bring opaque bottles.,
11857,ReGreen team are confident that the project for separate waste collection at the Polytechnic University can be an excellent example for scaling up in other universities in the city and country.,
11858,"However, they explain that today the system is in the developing stage, and they need our help to make the process convenient for everyone.",
11859,"“Use the new containers correctly and tell your colleagues and friends about the innovation,” eco-activists appeal to students and university staff.
",
11860,"On May 25th, 2018, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University international students of the pre-university program had their prom.",
11861,"This tradition had almost fizzled out but after a few years of no proms, thanks to the Higher School of International Educational Programs (HSIEP SPbPU) supported by the Polytechnic Tutor Forces, the Concert Hall of HSIEP flung open the doors for the graduates.",
11862,Let us remind that international students take foundation programs for their further enrollment to Russian schools of higher education under any educational program they choose.,
11863,"Future Bachelors, Specialists, and Masters study the Russian language plus disciplines of one of three areas of studies: engineering, economics, or humanities.",
11864,"Already next fall, in 2018, more than 300 graduates of the preparatory department will continue their education under SPbPU educational programs.",
11865,"As a rule, the graduation ball is the time to say good-bye to the school, recollect the funny and cheerless moments which have happened during the years of study, and get ready for a totally new life, very different from the studentship.",
11866,"For the students who have just graduated from the preparatory department, it is by far too early to bid farewell to the university: the most interesting events are still ahead.",
11867,"Exactly for that reason, the goal of the event that had taken place at HSIEP was to introduce the young peopleto the student clubs and organizations at Polytechnic University, contests and competitions, in which they should be able to manifest their talents, and other extracurricular activities.",
11868,Representatives of student clubs and various Polytechnic teams and SPbPU teachers came to greet the graduates.,
11869,"The intense concert program started with a performance of the “Polytechnic Star-2018,” the first grade student of the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics” (IAMM SPbPU) Yulia Sidorova who sang a song of popular rock star Pink “So What”.",
11870,After that a team of the PolyDance studio performed a contemporary stage dance.,
11871,The last year graduate of the preparatory department from Nicaragua Stephanie-A Mendieta sang the “Diamonds” song.,
11872,"A contestant of the “Polytechnic Star” Diana Polyakova, student of the Humanitarian Institute (HI SPbPU) presented one more song, while her team: Alyona Sukhikh, Alexandra Sinelnikova, an Ksenia Kondrya danced a contemporary dance.",
11873,Another dance showed members of the Tutor Forces.,
11874,The concert part was concluded by a musical potpourri on the topic of teaching students at Polytechnic: teachers of the Higher School of International Educational Programs made a nice show.,
11875,"The official award ceremony for the best international students, winners of Olympiads, continued the soiree.",
11876,Director of HSIEP V.V. KRASNOSHCHEKOV presented the diplomas.,
11877,The first and second places in the Olympiad in mathematics were taken by students from Vietnam Nguyen Dinh Huong and Nguyen Niu Kuang.,
11878,The third place was shared by the guys from China: Wang Chuan and Yu Junwei.,
11879,"In the Olympiad in physics, students from Vietnam again distinguished themselves: the first and third places were taken by Fan Nhat Tan and Nguyen Niu Kuang respectively.",
11880,The award ceremony concluded with presenting thank-you letters to concert organizers and SPbPU tutors from the Tutor Forces for their fruitful support.,
11881,"About one hundred students from China, Vietnam, Algeria, El Salvador, Colombia, Angola, Cameroon and other countries attended the soiree.",
11882,"They all highly appreciated the organization of the party and agreed that the tradition of proms for international students should go on.
",
11883,Dear university students and teachers!,

12013,"The graduate of the Graduate School of Nuclear and Thermal Power Engineering with a degree in Nuclear Power Plants Design, Operation and Engineering under the Educational Program ‘Design and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants’,” 1st Class Honors Student NGO Tan Phu was born into a peasant family in Long An Province on the border with Ho Chi Minh City.",
12014,"“As a child, I dreamed of becoming a doctor because I always thought it was one of the noblest professions, and on the other hand, doctors earn a lot of money,” he recalled.",
12015,"“I wanted to help my parents, at the time my family was very poor.",
12016,Mom sometimes couldn’t even afford to buy rice.”,
12017,"In high school, Tan Phu developed a passion for physics.",
12018,His literature teacher NSUEN Thi Quynh Giao helped him get into a Russian university.,
12019,"One day she read in a magazine that there was a scholarship to study in Russia as a physics engineer, and told her student about it.",
12020,And Tang Phu began to prepare to get that scholarship.,
12021,"“At school, I admired the heroic history of the Soviet Union.",
12022,So the dream of going to study in Russia had long been in my heart.,
12023,"And I wanted to experience life away from home, so I intentionally didn’t choose cities near Vietnam.”",
12024,"St. Petersburg attracted the young man, as well as many others, by its beauty, and Polytechnic University by the fact that “it is one of the best universities in Russia and in the world.",
12025,"And now, after completing my studies, I think that choosing SPbPU was the right decision.",
12026,"Because the teachers here are always friendly, ready to help, and treat international students very well.”",
12027,"Tan Phu remembered his first day in Russia - October 28, 2014.",
12028,"First, he studied Russian for a year at IMEP.",
12029,"“For me, Russian was a blank slate, I didn’t know a word.",
12030,It was very difficult to study.,
12031,"I studied almost all day, in the first months I did not sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning.",
12032,"In class, I listened carefully and watched the pronunciation of the teachers.",
12033,I read a lot to learn new words.,
12034,"Also, I often watched simple videos to improve my listening skills.”",
12035,"For further study, Tan Phu chose the Graduate School of Nuclear and Thermal Energy because it had a specialty that was interesting to him – “nuclear power plants.”",
12036,“I spent a lot of time reading books and materials.,
12037,"Of course, in class, I didn’t understand everything the teachers said.",
12038,But I would take notes and ask the teachers at the end of class.,
12039,And they were always happy to answer.,
12040,I very much want to thank the headmaster Alexander KALYUTIK and the Senior Lecturer Maxim KONYUSHIN for helping me during my studies.,
12041,Thank you for your energy and effort!,
12042,"Besides, I spent time rewriting lectures after classes, and for that, I want to thank Russian students, especially Anna POPOVA, Nina KOLOSOVA, Valeria SUBBOTINA, and Angelina FEOFANOVA.",
12043,"Thank you for helping us, international students, for lending us notes during our studies.",
12044,I’m very glad that you spent these years together with us!”,
12045,"In the dormitory, Tan Phu made many friends from Vietnam, Africa, and Albania.",
12046,"He still keeps in touch with Zak Bumaza, an Albanian who has already graduated and now works in Russia.",
12047,"“Zach knows French, Arabic, Russian, and now he is also learning English.",
12048,"He is very friendly and kind, never forgot to say good night,” smiles Tan Phu.",
12049,Our harsh climate was surprisingly easy for a guy from a southern country.,
12050,"“We, the younger generation, can adapt to any conditions,” he believes.",
12051,"- I even love the weather in St. Petersburg, it is like a ‘girl’ – rainy now, sunny then, now warm again, and then bitter cold.",
12052,"In the summer, during the period of white nights, I photographed the sky several times at 24:00, sent it to Vietnamese friends, and asked, ‘What time of the day did I take this picture?’",
12053,And everyone was wrong when answering!”,
12054,"As we wrapped up our conversation, Tan Phu once again thanked everyone who helped him achieve his goal.",
12055,“My father and mother were the first teachers in my life.,
12056,They were able to come out of poverty.,
12057,"Their experience taught me diligence, patience, optimism, and overcoming all difficulties, and taught me to appreciate everything around me.",
12058,"And I also want to express my gratitude to the governments of Vietnam and Russia, teachers, friends, and all my classmates!",
12059,"Without you, there would not be my success today.”",
12060,"For now, Tan Phu remains in St. Petersburg for the time being.",
12061,"“The border is still closed, we are waiting for the departure flights to be reunited with our families,”he explained.",
12062,"“If all goes well, we will return to Vietnam in March 2021.”",
12063,"By the way, NSU Tan Phu is the second student from Vietnam to win the gold medal for best graduate.",
12064,"The first was last year’s graduate NGUEN Tien Hoang.

12068,"«The name of the series — ‘The Polytechnic Arctic’ reflects its content as accurately as possible,» notes Alexander Prischepa, senior lecturer of DSC HI, who collected the material and read this video lecture.",
12069,"«After all, ice-class ships began to be designed at the Shipbuilding Department of Polytechnic Institute already at the beginning of the twentieth century.",

12071,A significant place in the series is also given to contemporary research by Polytechnic scientists.,
12072,"During our International Scientific Conference ‘The Arctic: History and Modernity,’ we can annually compare and see how far our researchers have progressed in such areas as modeling the behavior of ice fields, creating a methodology for power supply of Arctic settlements with the help of intelligent control systems, power installations of wind-diesel power plants, Arctic vehicles and other inventions.",

12079,"The dormitory is closed for quarantine, and the student himself has been in the hospital since April 2 under the supervision of doctors.",
12080,"Unfortunately, his immunity is undermined by diabetes.",
12081,"In this regard, we hereby provide the full text of the appeal of the Chief Physician which details the ways of the spread of infection, preventive measures, and precautions that we all must follow to avoid the mass spread of the disease: “Dear students and employees of Polytechnic University and J.I.

12082,I want to appeal to each of you personally.,
12083,"I’m sure that the leaders of your organizations, i.e., Andrei I. RUDSKOI and Aleksei V. FILIMONOV, will also join me.",
12084,"After two weeks of self-isolation, the situation remains tense and an increased threat of the spread of coronavirus infection (COVID 19) persists in our city.",
12085,"I find it necessary to bring to your attention that, despite the good weather and apparent well-being, we should not relax and take the situation irresponsibly.",
12086,It is during this period of pandemic development that we are most vulnerable!,
12087,"In the second half of April, the spread of the virus, uncontrolled from the point of view of epidemiology, is expected; that is, the virus will spread beyond the importation from outside (which can be controlled and prevented), but transmitting from person to person under various forms of contacting the virus: All of these ways of spread are extremely contagious, and the virus forgives no negligence!",
12088,"In the modern history of mankind, the COVID 19 pandemic will stay forever, as will the address of medical workers: “We work for you – you stay home for us!”",
12089,"Dear students, you are our children and grandchildren, and we always paternally worry about you, but now above all.",
12090,"Today, medical workers are doing everything in their power to protect and maintain your health.",
12091,Please do not neglect the rules of life dictated by the pandemic.,
12092,We all want it to end the soonest.,
12093,But just “wanting” is not enough: everyone needs to contribute.,
12094,It depends exactly on our behavior; each particular citizen impacts on the scenario according to which our country and city will live on (dysfunctional Italian and American or prosperous Korean).,
12095,"Obviously, the more organized we are in terms of prevention today, the faster the coronavirus will retreat.",
12096,We picked up the pace on the preparations for introducing telemedicine technologies into the practice of our clinic.,

12188,"SPbPU Chinese students told about the celebration of the Spring Festival Already very soon, Chinese students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University will celebrate their most popular holiday: the New Year by the traditional Chinese calendar.",
12189,"In mainland China, the festival is traditionally referred to as the Spring Festival.",
12190,"This year, more than one billion people all over the world will celebrate it on February 5; the Chinese New Year always begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.",
12191,"On the eve of the festival, we met with Chinese students studying at SPbPU in various educational programs to discuss with them the specifics and traditions on celebrating the Chinese New Year and to find out what they know about celebrations of the New Year in Russia.",
12192,Sun Zhen Zhe,
12193,The Chinese New Year has a lot of traditions.,
12194,"For example, the richer and tastier it is, the better and merrier will be the life through the next year.",
12195,"The main dish of the New Year table is Jiaozi, Chinese dumplings.",
12196,They are cooked with meat stuffing and symbolize the luck and unity of the family and friends.,
12197,Another popular dish in China is the “spring rolls” which are the symbol of richness.,
12198,"In our tradition, the fish symbolizes plentifulness.",
12199,And there is a very simple explanation for that: it is a must to serve it as a whole fish: the plentifulness should be full!,
12200,"At that, the head of the fish is “looking” at the most respected person at the table.",
12201,Another tradition is that the fish should never be completely eaten on the first day: a half of it should be left for the second day and eaten then.,
12202,This will provide for the whole year to live in affluence and plentitude.,
12203,"In your country, as much as I know, practically every family has the Salad Olivier, mandarins, and Champagne on the table.",
12204,"And my Russian friends told me about the popular New Year tradition: during the chime of bells, one should write a devout wish on a piece of paper, burn it to ashes, put them into the glass of Champagne and drink it.",
12205,They say that the New Year wishes always come true!,
12206,Zhao Qi Xian,
12207,"In Russia, everybody decorate Christmas trees on the New Year eve.",
12208,I read that it was Emperor Peter the Great who started this tradition.,
12209,"In China, we also have a tree symbolizing the New Year: the mandarin tree.",
12210,"It symbolizes the wealth and luck, and is traditionally put near the entrance door.",
12211,The Chinese take preparations for the New Year very seriously.,
12212,"A week before the day, they do the pre-festival cleaning of the house, “sweeping” away all the failures of the previous year and welcoming prosperity to their homes.",
12213,"And after that, the most interesting things start: decoration of houses and streets.",
12214,The main color is red: it is the symbol of luck and well-being; it also wards off evil spirits.,
12215,"One of the most popular decorations in China is the red diamond-shaped fu characters, which literally mean blessings, happiness, and prosperity.",
12216,The FU hieroglyphs are placed on the doors and on the walls.,
12217,"We also decorate our homes with red ribbons with good wishes, paper-cut decorations, and we put red flying paper lanterns outdoors, also symbolizing prosperity, luck, and success.",
12218,Chen Hujia,
12219,The tradition to give New Year presents is not that typical in China.,
12220,The most popular present is just a nice red envelope with some money.,
12221,"Most often, these would be given to kids.",
12222,"In general, it is quite typical to give money to any child coming to your home in the first 15 days of the New Year.",
12223,It is believed that such gift would put all evil spirits off the child and bring then the luck.,
12224,It was news for me that in Russia New Year gifts are put under the Christmas tree.,
12225,"By the way, both in Russia and in China, it is popular to give souvenirs with the New Year symbols.",
12226,2019 is the year of the Pig.,
12227,It is believed that all people in China know the East horoscope in all details and can clearly formulate what to expect in the year of the Pig.,
12228,"However, thats not true at all!",
12229,"Nevertheless, I am sure that the year of the Pig will be good for all of us., Chen Syhan First of all, the Chinese New Year means unification of generations.",
12230,"Several generations of the family get together at the table, enjoy the feast, and communicate with each other.",
12231,Each following festive day has its own symbols.,
12232,"For example, on the first day of the New Year, we all pay respects to our seniors; on the second day, the family visits the wife’s relatives.",
12233,The seventh day is considered the birthday of the humanity.,
12234,"On the fifteenth day, we celebrate the Festival of Lanterns.",
12235,Literally everything around is decorated with lanterns; public concerts and theatrical performances are taking place right in the streets; people play drums and other musical instruments.,
12236,All this is accompanied with bright fireworks.,
12237,The Chinese admire them.,

",
12271,"On February 16, the Adapters Public Institute celebrates its third birthday.",
12272,"One of the best-known among and well-liked by the students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, the project was launched exactly three years ago.",
12273,Our article tells about how it all started and how the adapters work.,
12274,"Today, the “Adapters” is a high-scale project with a well-set management structure and more than 450 activists from all institutes taking part in it.",
12275,The main activity of the organization is adaptation of freshmen and their engagement into the student life.,
12276,"Adapters are students of senior grades with proactive approaches to life, ready to share their experience and answer questions, and help to find ways to resolve any students’ issues.",
12277,They are always staying in touch with their groups and can come up with a friendly advice at any time.,
12278,The architect of the idea and the first leader of the “Adapters” PI was then yet a 3rd-grade student of the Institute of Civil Engineering (ICE) Nickolay BOLSHAKOV.,
12279,"Together with other activists, Nickolay made his first and major input into the project: he gave the opportunities for many students to realize their potentials and become an important part of the Polytechnic life.",
12280,“We owe the idea of establishing the “Adapters” to the Petrozavodsk State University where a similar organization has been operating for about ten years.,
12281,"As with many major Polytechnic students’ projects, it all started at the auditorium 349 of the 1st educational building,” Nickolay BOLSHAKOV is telling about the first steps on the way of establishing the public institute.",
12282,"“Along with my future deputy Andrey Novikov, Chair of the Student Union Maxim Pasholikov, and Artyom Maryukhta we stated the principles, goals, and objectives of the “Adapters.”",
12283,"Of course, the most important thing for us had always been working with students and strengthening of the Polytechnic community.",
12284,"And, despite the fact that adapters had already existed at other universities, in the realities of our university we had to do everything from the scratch: as in any other matter, you cannot just replicate the model.”",
12285,"As long as the project of the kind was established at Polytechnic for the first ever time, it was not enough just to bring together active and interested folks.",
12286,Coaching them was an important and inextricable part.,
12287,The leaders tried to give the activists a comprehensive vision of various students’ activities and the youth policies as a whole.,
12288,"We had held lectures and practical studies on proper holding trainings, student associations, university branding, social support, military and patriotic education, safety, and many other things.",
12289,"One of the main goals of the training has always been to make adapters very well-informed about the most important aspects of student life, ready to answer any questions of the freshmen.",
12290,"Besides this, expanding their own vision during the training course, adapters would find interesting spheres of activists for themselves and continued to develop in that direction.",
12291,The major debut event for the adapters took place on August 30-31 and September 1 of 2015.,
12292,"The first experience of coordinating major groups of freshmen helped our guys to correct their further actions: they came to some conclusions, took into consideration all comments, and already in 2016 and 2017, organization of the Days of Knowledge at Polytechnic had very much improved.",
12293,"Since then, the project started to gain momentum; presently, adapters are not limited with just helping freshmen.",
12294,"During the entire year, they take part in most of the major university events, work with volunteers and coordinators, and organize their own public and environmental actions.",
12295,"Besides the mass cultural events, they also develop in the sphere of working with high school students, alumni, and international students.",
12296,"In 2018, the “Adapters” Public Institute is developing rapidly under the command of the 4th grade ICE student Artyom POLUBEDOV.",
12297,"The new leader is quite successful in leading the adapters to the goals set and fulfilling the designed tasks, which include professional orientation and international activities of the university, deepening cooperation with the university in various aspects - from facilitating enhancement of the quality of education and up to the development of the social facilitation complex, reinstitution of the monitors corpus, and bringing it to a new qualitative level.

12300,"The organizers had to solve a number of essential tasks, many of which were to be dealt with for the first time.",
12301,"So, on September 16, the tutors announced the recruitment of a team of volunteers to the headquarters.",
12302,"This year, the command unit changed the traditional format of the school of tutors, which usually starts in September and lasts for one or two semesters.",
12303,"“We have decided to replace the school with a command unit, as this will allow more people to take part in the work.",
12304,Volunteers will be able to join the Tutor Forces tasks at will and free time.,
12305,The volunteer command unit is something like a trial period for future tutors and significant help and support for us.,
12306,"Next year we plan to hold a school of tutors in the usual format, and those guys who will prove themselves well in the volunteer headquarters will certainly get an advantage,” said Natalia IVANOVA, President of Tutor Forces.",
12307,"Volunteers will be trained gradually - first, several training sessions and team-building trainings are planned.",

12317,"On September 22, the tutors met with foreign students.",
12318,They talked about their activities and exchanged contacts - in case someone needs help.,
12319,"After that, all together discussed possible common events, upcoming excursions and meetings.",

12321,"The initiative to develop social activities on the basis of the Interclub received an active discussion - to interact with children from orphanages, to communicate, to hold holidays for them.",
12322,"Of course, they do that under the supervision of teachers and competent staff.",
12323,"Everyone who did not manage to get to the Tutor Forces Open Days can learn more about the community’s activities on its official pages at Facebook, Vontakte, or Instagram: tutors are available online, and are always open to new ideas and suggestions.

12336,"Recently I was in hospital - I had surgery on my leg, and they gave me shots every day,\rhe complained.",

12345,More than 60 foreign students from 18 countries will be studying at Polytechnic in the new autumn semester.,
12346,"The first ones arrived in Russia at the end of August, and some are just getting ready to go: the university will be welcoming exchange students until the end of September.",
12347,That’s why this years Welcome Week will last longer than usual so that as many foreigners as possible could join it.,
12348,", It can’t help but please us that this year we have the opportunity both to admit foreigners to Polytechnic University and to send Russians to partner universities under exchange programs.",
12349,We are in close contact with SPbPU’s foreign partners.,
12350,"The autumn semester of 2021 will see students from our friendly universities such as the Polytechnic University of Milan (Italy), Middle East Technical University in Ankara (Turkey), Technical University of Munich (Germany), Technical University of Dresden (Germany), and many others start their studies at Polytechnic.",
12351,"And more than 30 students of the Polytechnic University will study in Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (Finland), Istanbul Technical University (Turkey), University of Granada (Spain) and many others, said deputy head of the Department of International educational programs and academic mobility Elisabeth Sukhova.",
12352,"One of the key events of the Welcome Week was a kick-off meeting during which coordinators gave foreign students detailed information about education, accommodation, registration and migration rules, etc.",
12353,"The students also received student cards, passes, and sets of souvenirs with the university symbols.",
12354,"And at the end of the meeting, they had a brief excursion into the history of Polytechnic University.",
12355,An important task of Welcome Week is the process of international students adapting to life in Russia.,
12356,"For this purpose, a series of entertaining and informative events are held, in the organization of which TutorForces takes an active part.",
12357,At the very beginning of Welcome Week tutors organized a quiz about Russia.,
12358,"The participants answered questions about the cultural characteristics, history, and traditional dishes of the Russian cuisine.",
12359,Most of the answers were correct - the tutors noted the extensive knowledge of our country.,
12360,"Against the background of the discussed questions, the participants were able to get to know and get to know each other better.",
12361,One Sunday evening the international students had a master class in Zumba which was held by choreographer Ekaterina Savchenko.,
12362,Thrilling music and energetic dancing left nobody indifferent.,
12363,The participants learned new and original choreography and got a charge of energy and a positive mood.,
12364,"We are very grateful for the help, starting with meeting us at the airport, taking a PCR test, and buying a SIM card.",

12368,They also shared with us interesting information about the city and the university.,
12369,"All in all, it was a great experience filled with fun events and pleasant excitement.",
12370,Thank you!,
12371,"shared Adrian SCHOEBEL, a student from Germany.",
12372,Welcome Week consists not only of the group but also individual events.,
12373,One of them is a Day with Student Tutor.,
12374,"Every foreign student is assigned a tutor who makes an appointment with him and shows him some interesting places in St.Petersburg - it can be a museum, an exhibition, or a cozy coffee house.",
12375,"In this format, the international student has the opportunity not only to get acquainted with the city but also to talk about their experiences, to get support and attention.",
12376,"Shortly, tutors will hold a Speed Friending communication game for newly arrived students.",
12377,"During the game, participants will have 10-20 mini-meetings with other students in which they will discuss questions that will be prepared by the facilitator.",

",
12381,It’s been several days now that due to a confirmed case of a coronavirus-infected student at the Institute of Secondary Vocational Education dormitory No. 16 has been quarantined.,
12382,"The thorny situation rallied, without exaggeration, the entire Polytechnic University: from the university CEOs, who are part of the operational headquarters providing for functioning of quarantined students, to volunteers who constantly support the students in word and action.",
12383,"Thanks to the well-coordinated and timely organization of all processes - from nutrition and cleaning to psychological support and study - life in quarantine is going in a seamless way, disciplined and safe.",
12384,"But first things first: right on the first day of the quarantine announcement, all students living in the dormitory were tested for coronavirus, and round-the-clock medical supervision was organized.",
12385,"Three times a day, a doctor and a nurse from the city clinic number 76 round all the students, conduct inspection and measure their temperature.",
12386,It should be noted that the currently determined quarantine period is 14 days.,
12387,"All ISPO students living in the dormitory will undergo follow-up tests on the 10th day after the detected case of coronavirus infection, and subject to no positive samples, the quarantine will be removed.",
12388,"Quarantined students are supplied three meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner.",
12389,"The menu is very diverse and can satisfy all tastes and expectations: cereals, soups, chops, fish, meatballs with side dishes, fruit, pastries and much more.",
12390,"Upon personal students’ requests, they are provided with necessary personal hygiene items and medicines.",
12391,"For the convenience of the guys, a special group was created on the social network Vkontakte for messaging and operative communication on any issues.",
12392,"Vice-Rector for Youth Affairs Maxim PASHOLIKOV believes that it is important to give the students the feeling of support and help from the part of Polytechnic University: “It is very gratifying that all student associations, many departments of the university have joined this work: our athletes are laying out a special set of exercises so that the guys remain physically active in quarantine; the union shares its selections of interesting pastime options: which films to watch, what to play, and so on.",
12393,"Volunteers are in touch all the time, let it be even just chatting, talking, albeit remotely, but this is quite essential for the quarantined guys right now.”",
12394,"At any time, students can contact the psychologist, senior teacher of the Higher School of Psychology, Pedagogy and Applied Linguistics Denis NAZAROV.",
12395,Nazarov believes that by now the condition of the guys as calm and positive.,
12396,"Irina GROMOVA, chair of the student council of dormitory No. 16, who is also in quarantine in the dormitory, helps to cope with issues and responds to all requests and needs of students.",
12397,"“We can even say that everything is good in the dormitory now; the guys strongly support and cheer each other,” says ISPO student Denis ANDRIYANOV.",
12398,“Many are thankful for the free food.,
12399,"Of course, there are those who are worried about the situation, and we are doing our best to help them.",
12400,"It is lovely that many support us remotely, write and offer assistance.",
12401,"We hope for an early release, and many guys are already making plans for celebrating this day ”.",
12402,"Good nutrition and psychological comfort is important, but still the vital thing for a student is studying, and it should be noted that studying is going on despite the circumstances.",
12403,"Director of the Institute of Secondary Professional Education Roman BAYBIKOV comments: “The educational process has never stopped: since March 16, the students study remotely, and this is so all the time.",
12404,Students are provided with everything necessary for this.,
12405,"We are in constant contact with the students, and if a need for additional technical equipment or gadgets emerges, we will immediately bring those.”",
12406,"With the kind of support that entire Polytechnic University is now providing to its students in dormitory No. 16, any difficulties can be overcome, because together we are strong together!",
12407,"And to prove this, here is an incredibly moving video with words of support addressed to their quarantined students and friends from teachers and students of ISPO.
",
12408,Quarantine is no hindrance to communication: countries and universities observe the regime of self-isolation but this does not affect communication and cooperation.,
12409,"No doubt, meetings and negotiations are nowadays held online.",
12410,"However, Polytechnic University is in continuous contact with its colleagues and students abroad: we learn how the Polytechnic study in other countries and receive news and words of support from our foreign partners on daily basis.",
12411,"And, of course, it is vital in this difficult time to support international students who are currently studying at St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and are away from their family and from home.",
12412,We found out that an international student club is planning a series of distance events at PolyUnion; we also talked with foreign students at St. Petersburg Polytechnic University to find out how their lives have changed during the quarantine period.,
12413,Ma Wenjia (China) SPbPU Institute of Computer Science and Technology Polytechnic University promptly responded to the recommendations of the government.,
12414,"All students and staff switched to remote mode, and many resources, e.g., the SPbPU Electronic Library, became accessible not only to Polytechnic students but also all interested parties.",
12415,"I try to see the pros in everything: for example, the advantage of distance learning for me is that you can set your own pace of studying.",
12416,"In real life, a professor is unlikely to stop an entire lecture for the sake of one student.",
12417,Now you can put a halt on the lesson with one click to clarify the moment that interests you.,
12418,And online training is very comfortable: you can learn in your favorite pajamas with a cup of tea or coffee.,
12419,"This semester, I am doing research practice and working on a master’s thesis.",
12420,And on my own initiative I am taking courses on the Coursera educational platform.,
12421,"In my free time I read books that I have long wanted to read, but for the lack of time I set aside for later.",
12422,Now it has my dream has come true!,
12423,"It seems to me that the lines of the poem by the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley Ode to the West Wind are perfect for this whole situation: “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”",
12424,"Dawn always follows a dark night, and a warm spring follows a cold winter.",
12425,"We are fortunate to live in a world where thousands of people protect us: medical personnel, police officers, university staff, and so on.",
12426,"Therefore, what we should do now is to follow the professionals’ recommendations: wash our hands properly, go outside less and to observe personal distances.",
12427,"We can defeat the coronavirus, but we must be prepared to act correctly!",
12428,"Tamim Saadi (The Netherlands) SPbPU Institute of Industrial Management, Economics, and Trade The measures that Polytechnic University has taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection are similar to those carried out throughout Russia.",
12429,"For a while, we all will be learning remotely.",
12430,"This has its advantages: for example, to hook up to a lecture, a laptop and the Internet are enough.",
12431,"No need to waste time to get there; in this sense, my life with the transition to distance learning has even become easier.",
12432,"We all were given instructions, told how to use the Microsoft Team platform to attend classes online.",
12433,"When the lecture begins, you automatically receive a notification about it.",
12434,It’s hard to miss!,
12435,"In my leisure time, I do additional tasks for studying, watch movies or play games on my smart phone; in the evenings we gather with friends and communicate via the Internet.",
12436,I want to wish all students: do not panic!,
12437,"Panic is destructive, and brings only negative emotions.",
12438,Do not worry and spend time for good use!,
12439,Yu Xiaoyun (China) Student of the SPbPU Higher School of International Educational Programs «Я I am studying at the university foundation program.,
12440,"It seems to me that in this situation, the decision to switch to distance learning was the best option.",
12441,"Learning is a little bit unusual, but everything is going smoothly: we are moving in accordance with the content of the course; the schedule has not changed much.",
12442,"As before, teachers set homework, and despite the lack of personal communication, learning is still very interesting.",
12443,"In addition, we have more free time.",
12444,"I study Russian and English, and sometimes I draw.",
12445,"I want to wish all students to be conscious: stay at home, go out on the street less, follow the rules of personal hygiene, and also divide time for study and rest in a smart way!
",
12446,"According to the Russian State Project ‘5-100-2020’, one of the factors of competitive growth of Russian universities is increasing number of international students who come to study here.",
12447,Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University holds a position within the top three Russian universities by the number of international students.,
12448,Here at Polytech we know how to help them feel comfortable at a new place of studying.,
12449,"International students live in dormitories, know little about Russian traditions and Russian language and, of course, they need tutors and individual approach.",
12450,"Russian students - members of tutor organization Tutor Forces – help them with these issues., Please welcome!",
12451,"Sasha GLAZKOVA, Katya KOVALEVA and Dmitry BURANTSEV are third-year students of Institute of Industrial Management, Economics and Trade (IMET SPbPU).",
12452,They are a fundamental force of Polytechnic tutor organization.,
12453,There is one more person in this collaboration: teaching assistant at the Department of International Students Training Pavel Nedelko.,
12454,"He professes History for students, and became a thought leader of Tutor Forces.",
12455,", The members of tutor organization understand that for international students who come to study to Russia for the first time it is very important to have a person who can help them with all the emerging issues.",
12456,A tutor is both a friend and an instructor.,
12457,Lots of things are up to the Polytech tutor.,
12458,"It is not only help in getting accustomed to the new environment, but also organization of leisure time: concerts, museums, sights of St. Petersburg, cinema - there are plenty of various events.",
12459,"Tutors meet international students on their arrival to St. Petersburg, and spend a lot of time with them.",
12460,They should solve many different issues.,
12461,About some of them our Polytech tutors told us in their interviews.,
12462,"- Pavel, the first question is yours.",
12463,"Tell us, how did everything start?",
12464,Pavel:,
12465,"The idea to create a tutor organization came from SPbPU authorities: Vice-Rector for International Relations, prof.",
12466,D.G. ARSENIEV issued this suggestion.,
12467,And we did it.,
12468,"To help international students get accustomed to life at Polytech, make their living in Russia comfortable, help them with dormitories, timetables, etc. - these things are included in tutors duties.",
12469,"And as far as I have done it professionally, I needed assistants from the students.",
12470,That is how our organization has appeared.,
12471,Then we met Dmitry - he is a manager on the part of the students.,
12472,", Dmitry:",
12473,"Actually, duty positions are just a formal part of our work.",
12474,"We all here are doing more or less the same tasks; in general, we do everything together.",
12475,"Except three of us, there are a few students more, and for every event we involve volunteers in our work.",
12476,- We see that such a work demands a lot of altruism.,
12477,"An international student who is attached to you, can phone you at 3:00 a.m. and say that he has got lost.",
12478,"And even if it is necessary to meet him, you cannot turn your back on him, can you?, Pavel:",
12479,"Yes, every international student who comes to Polytech has a tutor - a person, who helps him in every issue.",
12480,We do everything absolutely voluntarily.,
12481,Before arrival we get a name of a student and his or her contacts.,
12482,"And then there can be different situations: someone repulses help, someone phones and says that he cannot find exit from airport.",
12483,- Are you really ready to keep in touch and solve such problems 24 hours a day?,
12484,Dmitry:,
12485,We do not have strong regulations on the time we spend with international students.,
12486,But if they phone us with some issue we cannot say them nay.,
12487,"We help international students with dormitories, everyday issues, and then they decide in their own account whether they wish to communicate with us or not.",
12488,So it depends on the students.,
12489,- You carry out a very serious mission.,
12490,"International student, who is for the first time in our country, would conclude about Russian people after communication with you.",
12491,It is very responsible!,
12492,Dmitry:,
12493,"Every tutors task is to show St. Petersburg, its citizens and our university to international students in such a way to make it something special.",
12494,"It is very important for him or her to fell here free and comfortable., - It is interesting to know about your own reasons: why did you decide to become a tutor?",
12495,"Pavel:When I was a student, I also worked as a volunteer: it was interesting for me.",
12496,"I met Julia TITOVA, who was an organizer of a voluntary shop Spasibo.",
12497,We are good friends.,
12498,"I have participated in this project since its beginning, it was funny, interesting, and there were creative people, so I was involved in this atmosphere.",
12499,"Then I took part in Ecology project, and some others, and finally came to the work with international students, and started working for establishment of a tutor organization.",
12500,", Dmitry:",
12501,"A studied at school with in-depth study of German, and went to Germany on a student mobility program.",
12502,"When Tutor Forces was established, I immediately joint it.",
12503,"I like to communicate with people, to learn them better.",
12504,"We always discuss things which surprise them in our culture, and international students tell us about traditions of their countries., Sasha: I also studied at school with in-deep study of foreign languages, and was interested in them.",
12505,"I speak German, English and recently have started studying Spanish.",
12506,"I took part in student mobility programs, went to Germany, and last year participated in international voluntary project in Greece.",
12507,I am fond of learning something new about foreign cultures and traditions.,
12508,"Maybe it is not always interesting to read books about it, but real-life communication is definitely amazing!",
12509,Kate:We have many different ways to communicate with international students.,
12510,"For example, it is group work, when two tutors organize for a group of international students some events.",
12511,"It can be excursion to some museum, or walk around the city.",
12512,"I love it, because when you do it by yourself, you can see the city from a new side.",
12513,- It seems you have lots of friends among international students?,
12514,Pavel:,
12515,"Yes, of course!",
12516,"As a teacher I often communicate with them, so I really have a lot of friends.",
12517,Dmitry:,
12518,Sasha is a very active tutor; she has a great number of international friends!,
12519,"For example, when we were first-year students, two international students from Germany came to SPbPU.",
12520,"Sasha and I met them once a week, and spend a whole day together walking on the streets and visiting museums.",
12521,And since that time we are still keeping in touch with them on Facebook.,
12522,"One of these girls visited St. Petersburg this summer, and, of course, we met with her.",
12523,Sasha:,
12524,Last semester I attended vocal lessons with two guys from Spain.,
12525,Every weekend during a half of the year we met and sang.,
12526,It was amazing - we tried to learn Spanish and Russian songs.,
12527,"Also we had a great opportunity to improve our German skills by participating special program, when you meet a native speaker in friendly atmosphere and change the language of communication from time to time.",
12528,"So the student from Germany helped me with German language, and I taught him Russian.",
12529,Students from Spain invited me to Valencia.,
12530,"Unfortunately I couldnt visit them in summer, but we have already come to agreement to meet in Valencia in winter., - Tell us about the events you organize for international students.",
12531,Pavel: There are different programs and events.,
12532,In the beginning the Tutor Forces was created for the students who come to Higher School of International Educational Programs of SPbPU to study foundation programs.,
12533,"They study here for a year and learn Russian language, History, Geography, Physics, Math - basic subjects, and then enter universities.",
12534,In most of the cases they prefer Polytech.,
12535,"We organize excursions and holidays for them, master classes, concerts and so on.",
12536,Some students come to SPbPU for a semester under the programs of academic mobility.,
12537,"And here we have another task: we should meet them in the airport, transport them to the dormitories, show and tell all the important things: for example, where students can buy a SIM card or medicines.",
12538,Also we have International Polytechnic Summer and Winter Schools.,
12539,"They have their own team of tutors, and their tasks are almost the same as ours.",
12540,", Kate:We have conducted survey among international students to find out what they are interested in.",
12541,I remember a girl from Morocco – Hannah ITRI.,
12542,She is so active!,
12543,I have never met such people!,
12544,"She speaks a great amount of foreign languages: one day we played a board game, and she had to explain some word.",
12545,"She started in Russian, continued in English, then - French, Turkish, Arabic and finally managed to explain it!",
12546,- Do you need to make international students participate in different evens?,
12547,"Kate:Some students and even groups of students are very interested in everything that is going on, and take part in various events with great pleasure.",
12548,"Dmitry:Of course, there are always some people, who do not participate.",
12549,"You can meet them in every group, and the reasons are very different.",
12550,"Someone is afraid of being active, someone is too shy.",
12551,"But, of course, we try to interest every student in our projects.",
12552,- There are lots of creative young people among international students.\r ?,
12553,"Pavel:It is true: for example, students from Turkey created here a rock band.",
12554,"We found musical instruments, a room, and now they have a place for musical rehearsals.",
12555,So there is a big number of really talented people among our students.,
12556,"- How can a person join your tutors team?, Dmitry:You should speak at least one foreign language, and have a desire to work with foreigners, to help them.",
12557,Sasha:,
12558,"Frankly speaking, knowledge of a foreign language is not always necessary.",
12559,"The main goal of international students is to learn Russian, that is why it wouldnt be worse if a tutor speaks only Russian.",
12560,"It may be more difficult, but also its an opportunity to learn Russian faster.",
12561,", Pavel:You should be responsible - this is the main factor, and Sasha always pays attention to it (smiles).",
12562,Sasha:,
12563,"Yes, it is important, because you should always be ready to explain elementary things: to show nearest shops, metro stations, pharmacies, to explain how it works.",
12564,"We have a special handbook, and there is a proper instruction how to tell about all these things and make a life of international student easier.",
12565,Tutors should have a good memory to keep in mind all these aspects.,
12566,Kate:,
12567,"It is important to be open-minded, friendly and non-contentious.",
12568,- What about any difficulties?,
12569,Do you have them?,
12570,Dmitry:,
12571,"Frankly speaking, we have lots of ideas, but we do not know how to implement some of them.",
12572,"For example, very soon our own site will start working, but we do not know how to integrate it with the University domain.",
12573,"Pavel:While we dont have funding, we try to compensate it somehow.",
12574,"For example, to connect some immaterial resources like student clubs or organizations.",
12575,"We can make lots of events together., - And what about your future plans?",
12576,Pavel: We want to open an international club in one of the dormitories.,
12577,"There will be Russian language club, concerts, cooking classes, movie screening - everything will be in one place.",
12578,"Now we do not have our own base: we are located at Higher School of International Educational Programs - when we need in communication, we meet in some of the classrooms.",
12579,During the last week of August we met about 100 international students.,
12580,We made a tour about our International campus for them and created an adventure game.,
12581,"Also we launched some free excursions about St. Petersburg, which would be held during September.",
12582,And in autumn School of Tutors starts working.,
12583,Dmitry: Information about this school you can find in our group.,
12584,We are waiting for everyone.,
12585,"We need people who are ready to participate in our events, their organization and develop tutor organization of SPbPU.",
12586,- Thank you very much for your interview!,
12587,"We wish you good luck in your important and responsible work!
",

12631,There were also calls for a university for all technical studies in Bavaria.,
12632,"The polytechnic schools set up in Augsburg, Munich and Nuremberg, which bridged the gap between middle schools and higher education colleges in their capacity as lyceums (or high schools), were the first approach.",
12633,"For further qualification purposes, a technical college was set up in 1833 as part of the Faculty of State Finance (Staatswirtschaftlichen Fakultät) of the Ludwig Maximilian University, which had been transferred from Landshut to Munich seven years previously.",
12634,The experiment failed.,
12635,"Instead, an advanced engineering course was established at the Polytechnic School Munich in 1840, which was the forerunner of what was later to become the Technische Hochschule München.,",

12648,"With an average of about 2,600 to 2,800 students, the TH München ranked ahead of the TH Berlin as the largest German Technical College for a while.",
12649,"The first female undergraduate matriculated in architecture in 1905, after the Bavarian government officially allowed women to study at a technical college in the German Reich.",
12650,"However the proportion of female students remained negligible; women accounted for just 0.6 per cent of the student body in the winter semester of 1913/14., During the Weimar Republic, the TH München was obliged to make due with low funds and was drawn into radical political struggles in 1918/19 and again between 1928 and 1933.",
12651,In the winter term of 1930/31 the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) became the strongest group within the AStA general student organisation of the THM for the first time.,
12652,The TH München was able to broaden its spectrum of subjects by taking over several smaller colleges that were no longer viable.,
12653,"In 1922, the former commercial college Handelshochschule München became the VII Department of Economics.",
12654,The former College of Agriculture and Brewing in Weihenstephan was integrated in 1930.,
12655,"Its agricultural unit was absorbed into the Department of Agriculture – which was located in Munich until 1947 before transferring toWeihenstephan, while the brewing section became Department VIII Brewing Technology belonging to the TH München yet located in Weihenstephan.",

12661,"Based on the newly introduced Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service lecturers of non-Aryan descent or those who were married to non-Aryans were removed by the State, likewise politically undesirable professors.",
12662,The National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) and the like-minded German Students Association (Deutsche Studentenschaft) endeavoured to organise and influence the undergraduates with their radical national socialist doctrine.,
12663,", Similar organisations were in place on the lecturers level.",
12664,Jewish students no longer enjoyed the same rights and were barred from matriculation from 1938 onwards.,
12665,The TH München was required to contribute towards the Second World War effort with large-scale armament research.,
12666,"However, top-level basic research was still conducted in numerous institutes.",
12667,"The attitude of the university professors was characterised by opportunistic conformance on the one hand, and critical distancing and inner emigration on the other.",
12668,"A number of individual professors, employees, workers and students dared to demonstrate disobedience and obstruction.",

12671,"For many years, undergraduates actively supported the rebuilding of their university by providing hands-on (voluntary) restoration service.",
12672,The Department of Economics had to be surrendered to the Ludwig Maximilian University in 1946.,
12673,"With the internationally acclaimed installation of the Research Reactor Munich (FRM) in Garching in 1956/57, the TH München gained third location.",
12674,"The Physics Department building was opened there in 1969, followed by the new building for housing the departments of Chemistry, Biology and Geoscience in 1977.",
12675,"In December 1957, the university was granted its long-standing request to acquire the status of a public legal body.",
12676,"In the following year, the first constitution drawn up by the university itself came into force.",
12677,"From the 1960s onwards, the university had to cope with an enormous influx of students.",
12678,"When the first economising measures were introduced by the State in the mid-Seventies, the conditions for students began to deteriorate.",
12679,", A Faculty for Medicine spanning two sites: Munich-Haidhausen (Clinic right of the Isar) and Munich-Schwabing (Biederstein, Childrens Clinic at Schwabing Hospital) was founded in 1967.",

12682,"In the 100th year since its foundation, the TH München comprised six faculties, 168 chairs and institutes, about 8,400 undergraduates and somewhere in the region of 5,700 university staff, who were employed in teaching, research, running operations and administration.",
12683,"In 1972, a sports centre with a central sports ground covering an area of 45 hectares, that had previously been used for the Olympic Games was set up in the grounds of the Olympic stadion.",
12684,", The new designation of Technische Universität München was conferred in August 1970.",
12685,"With the introduction of the Bavarian Higher Education Law in 1974, the six faculties were replaced by eleven smaller departments, which soon resumed the designation of Faculties: 1.

12754,Sam Altman discusses ChatGPT at TUM Few technological developments have triggered as much debate as the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT.,
12755,"Sam Altman, the mind behind ChatGPT and co-founder of OpenAI, visited TUM today.",
12756,"He explained what lies behind the success of ChatGPT, why it is not an open-source technology and how it might be regulated.",
12757,The 1100-seat Audimax auditorium was fully booked within half an hour for the 38-year-old tech CEO’s only public event in Germany on his European tour.,
12758,"With moderation by Reinhard Heckel, professor for machine learning, Sam Altman and OpenAI developer Johannes Heidecke described the development of the language model up to the current fourth version.",
12759,"„Even by GPT-3 not the whole company was convinced”, said Altman.",
12760,"Crucial to the success was the chat functionality in natural language, which is a better human-computer interface than the touchscreen, he explained.",
12761,But the mistake of thinking of ChatGPT as an huge database still persists.,
12762,"Altman explained why OpenAI made the technology publicly available at an early stage, following a “show, don’t tell” approach: „We very strongly believe that it is important to educate the world about this and for people to have time to adapt gradually.”",
12763,This permits debate on artificial intelligence.,
12764,That is better than keeping technologies secret in labs for a long time because releasing it too early would allegedly scare people.,

12769,"„We want to be relatively sure that when we open source a model we understand those capabilities and the impact they have on society, because you can’t take it back.”",
12770,"In principle, people must retain control over the technology, he believes.",
12771,Altman also commented on the regulation of artificial intelligence: “Some sort of international framework is a very good idea and we should start with that as soon as we can.”,
12772,"As an example, he mentioned the work of the International Atomic Energy Commission.",
12773,"He opposes the idea of hitting the pause button on the development of powerful AI systems, as recently demanded by other entrepreneurs.",
12774,"OpenAI now wants to see what values and limits users want for ChatGPT and how the system should be adapted to different countries, legal systems and cultures.",
12775,"Asked about the differences between the American and European technology sectors, Altman noted the greater openness to risk in the USA: „It’s socially acceptable to work on something super ambitious.”",
12776,"If you fail, people don’t make fun of you.",
12777,Students in Europe should not be discouraged.,

12814,"Using organoids to learn about autism Microglia cells, which play a major role in the immune system of the brain, are difficult to study.",
12815,Researchers have now succeeded in modelling the development of the brain and its immune system using organoids.,
12816,"With these miniature models of groups of brain cells, they have investigated changes associated with a certain type of autism spectrum disorder.",
12817,This approach can also be used to study other conditions.,
12818,"In the brain, microglia perform such functions as engulfing damaged nerve cells and removing the debris.",
12819,They can also promote the growth of neurons.,
12820,"As a result, they play an important role in the development of the brain and in diseases of the nervous system.",
12821,"Until now, many aspects of how microglia function have remained unknown.",
12822,This is partly because their behavior under laboratory conditions is fundamentally different than in the human body.,
12823,"An international research team in which Simon Schäfer, Professor for Advanced Organoid Technologies for Mental Health Research at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), has made decisive contributions, describes an approach to this problem in the journal Cell.",
12824,"“Outside of the brain environment, microglia lose almost all function and meaning,” says Prof. Rusty Gage, senior author and holder of the Vi and John Alder Chair for Research on Age-Related Neurodegenerative Disease at the Salk Institute in California.",
12825,"“We knew that if we found a way to replicate the human brain environment in an organoid in order to study human microglia, then we would finally have a tool for examining how the healthy and diseased brain influence microglia and, reciprocally, how healthy and diseased microglia influence the brain.”",
12826,The team developed a process for producing microglia from human pluripotent stem cells.,
12827,"Using these stem cells, the researchers were also able to produce an organoid with approximately 5 millimeters in diameter.",
12828,"In contrast to previous brain organoids, it permits the modelling not only of the initial stage of brain development, but also subsequent stages.",
12829,This is an important prerequisite for studying diseases that occur later in life.,
12830,"“Organoids are often described as miniature versions of organs,” says Simon Schäfer.",
12831,“But that creates false associations in this context.,
12832,"When we think about the brain, we think about consciousness, sensations and thought.",
12833,Our organoids are not able to do that.,
12834,Nor is that our intention.”,
12835,"Although organoids contain neurons that communicate with one another, he explains, they lack the networking between different areas that is necessary for thought and consciousness.",
12836,"“More realistically, we should think of them as three-dimensional cell systems that we use to model aspects of brain development,” says Schäfer.",
12837,As the next step the team developed a process to seed the stem cell-derived microglia into organoids.,
12838,This made it possible to model an additional process in the development of the brain: microglia do not move into the area that later forms the brain until around the fifth week of pregnancy.,
12839,"Until now, microglia or organoids in a petri dish did not behave in the same way as in the human body.",
12840,"However, the team was able to implant the organoids into mice.",
12841,In a living organism the microglia behaved like their counterparts in the brain.,
12842,They multiplied and were able to eliminate damaged neurons in the organoid.,
12843,"“We’re now trying to find out how we can get our organoids in the petri dish to behave like those in the body,” says Simon Schäfer.",
12844,"With the new organoid system, the researchers want to learn more about how the brain develops.",
12845,"They also want to contribute to a better understanding of individual diseases: The scientists used skin cells from three patients with macrocephalic autism spectrum disorder to create stem cells, which they used to produce organoids and microglia cells.",
12846,Past studies have revealed unusual behavior in neurons and microglia in patients with this disorder.,
12847,The team has now shown that these differences also occur in the organoids.,
12848,"“Our experiments showed that microglia in organoids derived from patients’ stem cells are more reactive to damaged cells than in organoids made with cells derived from control group individuals,” says Simon Schäfer.",
12849,This change in behaviorwas also observed when microglia from the stem cells of the control group were seeded into brain organoids of patients.,
12850,"Consequently, this is more likely to be caused by changes in the brain environment rather than in the microglia’s own characteristics.",
12851,This could explain the origin of the inflammatory processes in the brain often seen with this condition.,
12852,Simon Schäfer has been conducting research at TUM since 2022.,
12853,"His research group will participate in the interdisciplinary research of the Center for Organoid Systems, among other areas.",
12854,Research on brain organoids is one of three core topics of the new center.,
12855,In recent months other teams at TUM have published acclaimed studies on pancreatic and heart organoids.,
12856,"“At TUM we will continue developing the brain model in order to find new links between the brain and the immune system,” says Simon Schäfer.",
12857,"“We also plan to develop stem cell-induced glial cells to make it possible to repair or replace tissue in case of brain damage.”

13105,"After years as a VFX artist in the English games industry, she now works remotely for a Viennese games studio.",
13106,"Anja Sommeregger was fascinated by computer design at an early age, when she was still at grammar school.",
13107,"I developed my first digital artwork on the computer for my Matura with a focus on computer science, says the 32-year-old.",
13108,"After that, it was clear to her that she should continue in this way: I looked at a few art universities, but then decided on the MultiMediaArt programme at FH Salzburg, because the clear process of an FH degree programme particularly appealed to me.",
13109,"In her bachelor\s degree, Sommeregger specialised in computer animation.",
13110,"One highlight was winning the prestigious ADC (Art Directors Club) Young Talent Award with the 3D short film Blood, Sweat & Gingerbread, in which she worked as a 3D artist.",
13111,"During the subsequent MultiMediaArtMaster\s programme, Sommeregger became increasingly interested in games and visual effects (VFX).",
13112,VFX artists work everywhere where impressive graphic effects can be seen.,
13113,"This can be in a boss fight, for example, where movement combinations are graphically pimped, or when it comes to depicting explosions, fire, liquids or weather phenomena.",

13119,Working at TT Games was a great experience.,
13120,"At that time, the team consisted of about 250 employees, many of them from countries like Italy, Portugal or Poland - a colourful, international community in which we quickly made friends and where real friendships developed.",

13122,"We missed our families too much for that, and the weather left a lot to be desired.",
13123,The birth of her daughter then tipped the scales to return to Austria.,

13134,"Together with Simon Ginzinger, expert in data ambiguity he taught the subject Predictive Analytics at the study program MultiMediaTechnology.",
13135,"As part of their classes, the two researchers developed a computer model to predict the individual learning success of their students.",
13136,"To this end, participants in the course filled out an online questionnaire after each learning unit that assessed various factors influencing their performance (e.g. prior knowledge, interest, comprehension, time investment for homework, employment, etc.).",
13137,The data collected in this way were used to train a predictive model that individually forecasted final course grades.,
13138,"We succeeded in making a correct prediction in 79% of the cases, Ginzinger explains.",
13139,How can the findings be used?,
13140,"Our tool can act as a pre-alert system that gives students continuous feedback on their current performance, and it also provides information on where there is room for improvement, reveals Ginzinger.",
13141,The two researchers see great potential and will continue their computer model starting in the fall as part of an internally funded project at the FH Salzburg.,
13142,"The goal is to develop a solution that can be used by both students and teachers.

13150,"In this way, the FH is to offer students better points of contact for internships or semesters abroad, but also become more interesting for international lecturers.",
13151,"His credo of courage to innovate has already been largely met with the new division of teaching and research into forward-looking departments: Green Engineering & Circular Design, Information Technologies and Digitalisation, Creative Technologies, Business & Tourism, Health Sciences, Applied Social Sciences.",
13152,These are precisely the central future fields in which the economy and society are developing.,

13275,"Varied… After completing his A-levels with a focus on economics in Bavaria, Magnus applied at FH Salzburg.",
13276,"I really liked the combination of creative and business content, he says, explaining his choice.",
13277,"After all, he also wanted to earn money with his talent for creative design and do something socially relevant.",
13278,"I never saw myself as a breadless artist, he smiles.",
13279,"In his Bachelors degree programme, he learned one thing above all: flexibility and openness to new things.",
13280,", The studies were incredibly varied: in the morning we built models in the workshop, then in the afternoon we did statistical evaluations or discussed business management topics.",
13281,This ability to quickly familiarise himself with new topics and to delve deeper into them now benefits him greatly.,
13282,"This openness is a big plus of this degree programme, he is convinced.",
13283,…and international,
13284,"In retrospect, Magnus also benefited greatly from the international orientation of the degree programme: Great importance was attached to us getting out of the Kuchl cosmos.",
13285,The four-week trip to China remains unforgettable for him.,
13286,"As a 19-year-old, that made a big impression on me A semester abroad in Sweden gave him additional know-how in the field of international marketing.",
13287,"Even before finishing his Master\s degree, an internship took him to Hamburg for a few months.",
13288,"After he had his Master\s degree in his pocket, he returned there and stayed for six years, working as a designer at the design office Mutter.",
13289,The office had hired him because of his focus on the circular economy.,
13290,"In a team effort with his colleagues at Mutter, he managed to shift the agency\s focus towards organic food and sustainability clients in the following years.",
13291,"It was a very exciting time, I learned a lot there In 2018, he returned to Salzburg and started his own business here under the name fibra.",
13292,"With three small children, I really appreciate the flexibility that my self-employment brings, Magnus says.",
13293,"His clients from the organic food, sustainable innovation and social impact sectors aptly reflect how he would like to position himself as a service provider in the future.",
13294,"He is less concerned with the growth of his own organisation, but rather with using his skills as effectively as possible for a specific group of companies.",
13295,"In almost all of its assignments, fibra works in collaboration with other experts.",
13296,Long-standing partnerships in the old home of Hamburg and a wide-ranging network within the organic sector help to form the right team for every assignment.,
13297,"Magnus describes it like this: In order to be able to answer complex questions in the sense of the client, you need many experts at one table.",
13298,Everyone contributes their special knowledge and in the end everyone has gained new knowledge.,
13299,"Since 2017, Magnus Fischer has also been teaching his own knowledge about recyclable packaging design at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences.",
13300,"In addition, he has also been working as an external lecturer at the FH Wieselburg since last year.",
13301,"And so that he doesn\t get bored, he also organises the Organic Food Camp, which has established itself as a platform for exchange within the industry.",
13302,His ambition is to further develop this format and expand the existing networks.,
13303,And what does he enjoy most in all his activities?,
13304,My biggest drive is to use design as a tool to move people to action.,
13305,"Currently, there are many learned patterns that need to be broken up.",
13306,"You can rarely do that with a pointed finger, but very often with subtle messages that design can translate directly into emotions at the level of sensory perception.",

13329,The first democratic foundation of a German university Universität Hamburg celebrated its one hundredth anniversary in 2019.,
13330,"One century ago, it was born of the spirit of democracy that swept Germany as the Weimar Republic was founded.",
13331,"On 28 March 1919, the new Hamburg Parliament passed a resolution to establish a university.",
13332,"It was the first parliament chosen by the citizens of Hamburg in a free and fair election, making Universität Hamburg the first democratically founded university in Germany.",
13333,"It opened on 10 May 1919, and a concert in the music hall marked the occasion.",
13334,"Roots in the early seventeenth century The origins of the University date back 400 years to the Akademisches Gymnasium, which operated between 1613 and 1833.",
13335,"By 1895, a “general lecture series” had remained, which gave interested citizens of Hamburg an opportunity to further their knowledge with public lectures on a wide range of topics.",
13336,"The merchant Edmund Siemers donated a lecture building for that purpose in 1911, located on the street which was later named after him.",
13337,"Above the entrance of the lecture hall, you can still read its early motto: DER FORSCHUNG, DER LEHRE, DER BILDUNG (“To research, to teach, to educate and form”).",
13338,The establishment of the Hamburg scientific foundation Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung (HWS) in 1907 and the Colonial Institute in 1908 further paved the way for the eventual formation of the University.,
13339,The HWS recruited scholars and supported research excursions and academic publications to prepare new colonial officers for their work abroad.,
13340,"During the nineteenth century, several academic institutes developed in addition to the Akademisches Gymnasium: the Botanical Garden (1821), the Hamburg Observatory (1833), the state chemistry laboratory (Chemisches Staatslaboratorium, 1878), the state physics laboratory (Physikalisches Staatslaboratorium, 1885), the laboratory for commodity science (Laboratorium für Warenkunde, 1885) and the institute for seaborne and tropical diseases (Institut für Schiffs- und Tropenkrankheiten, 1900).",
13341,"Rise in the Weimar Republic, downfall under National Socialism",
13342,The young university’s early days in the 1920s were marked by success.,
13343,"Thanks to its outstanding scholars, it soon rose to international fame during the era of the Weimar Republic: as shown by such luminaries as Ernst Cassirer (philosophy), Albrecht Mendelssohn Bartholdy (law), Erwin Panofsky (art history), Otto Stern (physical chemistry), and William Stern (psychology).",
13344,"After the National Socialists seized power, many of these scholars were expelled on account of being Jewish.",
13345,The dismissals hit the University hard.,
13346,"Today, they are immortalized in the names of lecture halls, sculptures and commemorative plaques alongside the students who joined the Hamburg branch of the “Weiße Rose” (white roses) and sacrificed their lives resisting the cruel regime.",
13347,"After re-opening in 1945: growth and reforms The University closed after the fall of the “Third Reich”, but it had already re-opened by November 1945.",
13348,"The 4 faculties that had existed since 1919 (Law and Public Administration, Medicine, Philosophy, Natural Sciences) became 6 in 1954, as the Faculty of Protestant Theology was established, and the Faculty of Law and Public Administration was split into a Faculty of Law and a Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences.",
13349,"More and more students enrolled, and the student body grew from 3,000 in 1949 to 17,000 in 1964.",
13350,The Von-Melle-Park Campus was built during that period.,
13351,"In 1969, the Hamburg Parliament decided on fundamental reforms to the University.",
13352,It gave participation rights to all members of the University and expanded academic self-governance.,
13353,"The 6 faculties were separated into 15 departments; by the early 2000s, their number increased to 19.",
13354,A full-time university president overseeing a central administration was appointed to replace the rector.,
13355,"Following a later reform of the framework act for higher education (Hochschulrahmengesetz, HRG) in 2003, the president is now elected by the University Senate and confirmed by the University Council.",
13356,"In 2005, the University’s faculties were re-organized, and as of 2014, it has 8: Law, Economics and Social Sciences, Medicine, Education, the Humanities, Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Psychology and Human Movement Science, and Business Administration.",
13357,"More than 40,000 students are enrolled in these faculties.",
13358,"An urban university Following the expansion of the Von-Melle-Park Campus in the mid-1960s, the university quarter grew towards the Bundesstrasse, where the 22-floor Geomatikum was built in the 1970s.",
13359,"With its several campuses, the University is present across the entire Hamburg metropolitan area.",
13360,"This includes the central Von-Melle-Park campus, the climate and geosciences precinct on the Bundesstrasse campus, the Eppendorf campus dedicated to medical training, the Bahrenfeld campus housing the physics institutes, and the Klein Flottbek campus with the Institute of Plant Science and Microbiology and the Botanical Garden.",

13410,"[This years Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to three pioneers of cryo-electron microscopy, a path-breaking technology enabling us to examine native biological samples using high resolution at low temperatures.",
13411,Structural biologist Prof. Dr. Kay Grünewald researches in this field and explains to us why this technology is such a huge breakthrough for biology.,
13412,", Cryo-elctron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows us to analyze in 3D the individual macromolecules directly in their native watery environment and their functional interaction.",
13413,This also closes a gap in biological structural determination.,
13414,"Previously, specimens were typically prepared by chemical fixation, dehydration, staining, and embedding in resins.",
13415,These methods also create artefacts.,
13416,"The cryo-preparation introduced by Jacques Dubochet’s team, however, leaves the specimen in its watery environment while preserving its structural integrity all the way down to atomic level.",
13417,About 4 years ago there was a breakthrough in resolution with the introduction of direct electron detectors.,
13418,The Prizewinner Richard Henderson and his group were among the leaders in this field.,
13419,"The detectors make proteins—down to their amino acid side chains—visible at atomic level, for example.",
13420,We can now use this structural information to decode and understand fundamental biological functions.,
13421,We need to master three technical challenges: 1) Specimens must be frozen very quickly.,
13422,The goal is to avoid the development of crystalline ice and to embed them in glass-like ice.,
13423,This process is called “vitrification.”,
13424,2) Specimens prepared thus are cooled with liquid nitrogen at roughly 180 C and analyzed using very low electron radiation in the electron microscope.,
13425,The latter is important to avoid damaging the structure of the biological specimen.,
13426,Highly sensitive cameras—nowadays generally direct electron detectors—create images of the specimen.,
13427,"3) Finally, using sophisticated methods of analysis—Prizewinner Joachim Frank and his group did the groundwork here—several of these images are calculated, visualized, and analyzed as three-dimensional biological macromolecules with the aid of computer clusters.",
13428,At CSSB we are primarily investigating molecular interactions between pathogens and their host cells.,
13429,"In my working group, these pathogens are generally viruses.",
13430,"The goal is to better understand important steps in a virus’ entry into the cell, the assembling of the virus, and its morphogenesis.",
13431,This also helps us find approaches to intervention.,
13432,"We focus on herpes, adeno-, and retroviruses.",
13433,We also use viruses as markers to work on basic questions in cell biology.,
13434,"To do so, we use cryo-electron microscopy; one of two main modalities of cryo-EM allows us to analyze macromolecules directly in their native cellular environment.",
13435,This way we can grasp important cellular mechanisms such as intracellular transport and membrane infusion.,
13436,"This involves combining information from the cryo-EM using an integrative structural biology approach and findings from other fields such as biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, or mass spectrometry.

13445,The Parliament had been elected just 2 weeks earlier.,
13446,"Prior to that, Hamburg had a class-based electoral system that virtually dis-empowered the majority of the population.",
13447,The German or November Revolution of 1918 swept this system away and replaced it with a democratic electoral system.,
13448,"Thus, on 16 March1919, men and women alike cast their secret ballots in Hamburg’s first general, equal, and direct parliamentary election.",
13449,A democratically elected parliament was a breakthrough for the founding of the university.,
13450,"Earlier Werner von Melle (1853–1937), senator and then mayor, had called for the establishment of a university; however, too many members of a parliament based on the old electoral model wanted Hamburg to remain a commercial hub.",
13451,They feared both the expense of a university and social competition from a scholarly elite.,
13452,"Most of the merchants felt that university education for their sons, at least in Hamburg, was superfluous—to say nothing, of course, of their daughters.",
13453,"Things changed in 1919, when the Social Democrats clinched the absolute majority in the newly elected Hamburg Parliament.",
13454,"They were determined to ensure access to education for all, not just for an elite.",
13455,"They introduced a bill with a proposal not just for a university but for a Volkshochschule, or adult education center open to all.",
13456,"Accordingly, on 28 March 1919, Hamburg Parliament passed a preliminary act to found Hamburgische Universität, or Hamburg University, and a Volkshochschule—one of its first resolutions.",

13469,"In the years following a war, unfortunately, even more people usually die than during the conflict itself.",
13470,This is due to the destruction of the environment and of peoples livelihoods.,
13471,"I am sure that if environmental protection aspects were taken into greater account in international agreements like the Hague and Geneva Conventions from the very beginning, this could mitigate the consequences of war.",
13472,How this idea could be implemented in international treaties and humanitarian response is what I am working on here in Hamburg.,
13473,In 2022 the international community took a big step forward in this direction; the UN International Law Commission developed the principles on protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts.,
13474,", I am especially fascinated about the planning challenges of cities on water, especially if these are subject to dynamic tidal rhythms and the risk of flooding.",
13475,"This perfectly describes Hamburg and the Hafencity harbor district, the development of which I have followed closely.",
13476,I have also done a lot of research on the 20-million-strong Chinese city of Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta.,
13477,"As they do here, the urban planning projects there have increasingly involved 3D modeling and visualization.",
13478,These images can give simulate a reality at an early stage in the planning process to decision-makers even though detailed decisions have usually not yet been made.,
13479,"Furthermore, many important factors usually get sidelined in the visualization process: background noise, for example, the feel of the material, or the climate in a given district.",

13501,"Ultimately, AI like ChatGPT will influence what the workplace will look like in the future.",
13502,Similarly in this context we have to ask ourselves what skills can be provided by the education system and confirmed by the qualifications it provides.,
13503,"The fact that AI like ChatGPT can take over the pure reproduction of knowledge clearly shows again that having this as an educational goal and examination focus is insufficient, and emphasizes the relevance of skills like critical thinking.",
13504,Prof. Dr. Lohmann: ChatGPT is just the tip of the iceberg.,
13505,"AI-based tools are going to change all aspects of life, from the health system, to legal advice, to the entertainment industry and all kinds of economic activity.",
13506,Speed is also a factor here.,
13507,The first one to use an opportunity is going to have a massive advantage that others may not be able to make up for later.,
13508,"The opportunities are huge, but won’t last long as there are entire markets to corner.",
13509,"The battle has already started and we will see whether ChatGPT and Microsoft can stay out in front, or whether Google will catch up with Bard, particularly in terms of the costs of use, copyright, privacy, and data protection.",
13510,Prof. Dr. van den,
13511,"Ham: ChatGPT can take care of run of the mill daily activities, saving time and resources.",
13512,"For example, it can help to generate material in simplified language, summarize texts, generate tasks and exercises, and assist when programming and fixing code, etc.",
13513,"However, this requires that the users have the required skills to work with this tool, to ask the right question or prompts and reflect on the output and assess its content.",
13514,"Prof. Dr. Lohmann: To understand the opportunities, we have to consider that in principle, anyone using AI tools can produce just about anything, from programming through to whole video games, without knowing how to write a line of code themselves.",
13515,We can already see that ChatGPT can program.,
13516,And there are AI-based tools that can create whole videos in response to simple prompts in real time.,
13517,"While the result still looks quite simplistic, in a few years, the quality will reach that of films you see in the cinema.",
13518,"It makes me think of the science-fiction novel The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson from the 90s, subtitled “A young lady’s illustrated primer,” which is actually a coming of age novel.",
13519,"The illustrated primer is a fictive AI device, no bigger than a tablet, developed according to the most advanced technology and morals, which answers all the questions posed by the young user, Nell, and helps her make sense of her world.",
13520,"The vision could be to provide personalized education for all learners, driven by such AI-based “primers.”",
13521,"The educational system could, providing it has the required money, time, and access, make the dream of Czech philosopher Comenius’ dream come true, to make all knowledge available to everyone in a broad range of ways.",
13522,Prof. Dr. Lohmann: AI is definitely going to change the way we learn.,
13523,"How exactly, can be discussed in light of activity theories following the tradition of cultural-historical approaches founded by Wygotski, Leontjew, Lurija, and others.",
13524,This theoretical approach takes up the question of development and use of cultural tools and looks like a good starting point.,
13525,"Generally, we need a circular construction of knowledge, skills, and judgment to structure the acquisition of knowledge.",
13526,And time to try it all out.,
13527,"That doesn’t change anything, particularly not when the individuals doing the learning have themselves become the subjects of knowledge.",
13528,Prof. Dr. van den,
13529,Ham: ChatGPT offers new opportunities for learning.,
13530,"As we have said, learners can ask questions and find out more about complex topics by asking more and more targeted follow-up questions.",
13531,And ChatGPT can solve tasks and also write texts.,
13532,That makes it all the more important to focus on learners motivation and to consistently address it.,
13533,"For example, we need to highlight the advantages of “writing it yourself.”",
13534,"In addition, the ability to critically evaluate and revise texts also comes to the fore.",

13536,The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has awarded Prof. Dr. Anne van Aaken from Universität Hamburg with the renowned Alexander von Humboldt Professorship in Berlin.,
13537,Prof. van Aaken is recognized internationally as a distinguished expert in the field of economic analysis of law.,
13538,"She investigates fundamental questions of international law, with a particular focus on international economic law and legal theory.",
13539,"The Alexander von Humboldt Professorship, valued at 5 million Euro, is the most valuable international research award in Germany.",
13540,"The honor was bestowed by Minister for Education and Research, Anja Karliczek and the President of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Hans-Christian Pape.",
13541,"The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has been awarding this distinction to leading, internationally active researchers from all disciplines since 2008.",
13542,"In that time, 50 professorships for up to 5 years each have been granted, in an effort encourage internationally renowned researchers to Germany and strengthen the German research field.",
13543,Prof. Dr. Anne van Aaken is the first female legal scholar in Germany to be awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship.,
13544,"This is the third Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Universität Hamburg, with Prof. van Aaken to join particle physicist Prof. Dr. Brian Foster and art historian Prof. Dr. Frank Fehrenbach.",
13545,"Van Aaken’s research explores the boundaries between law and economics, particularly in international law and behavioral economics.",
13546,"At Universität Hamburg, she strengthens the faculty’s two current areas of potential, “International Affairs, European and Transnational Law” and “Law in Context” in the field of “Behavioral Law and Economics” research.",
13547,Her research provides an important link between legal and economic research in Hamburg and the fundamental research conducted into theoretical questions of international law and the interface between the economic and social sciences.,
13548,"In his laudation, President, Prof. Dr. Dieter Lenzen, said “With Anne van Aaken, we have succeeded in appointing an exceptional scholar to the Faculty of Law.",
13549,"Bringing an innovative approach to legal research, with field experiments and laboratory tests, Anne van Aaken has successfully provided useful experimental insights for shaping the law.",
13550,"Her research encompasses an area that stretches from international commercial law through to issues like corruption, and the supervision and regulation of financial markets.",
13551,"Prior to her appointment at Universität Hamburg, Anne van Aaken worked as Professor of Law and Economics, Legal Theory, International and European Law at the University of St Gallen.",
13552,"After completing her doctoral studies in 2001 at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder), and positions as a postdoctoral research associate at the Humboldt University, and as a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg and Bonn, she began a tenure-track professorship at the University of St Gallen in 2006.",
13553,She completed her habilitation (postdoctoral qualification) in 2012 at Osnabrück University.,
13554,She was also a Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin during the academic year 2010/2011.,
13555,Anne van Aaken moved to Universität Hamburg on 1 August 2018.,
13556,"The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has posted a video portrait of Prof. Dr. Anne van Aaken on its website.

13557,A participant in the seminar on the scent of antiquity removes excess water from the extracted fragrance oil with a pipette.,
13558,"Fenugreek, flower petals, and cardamom seeds are among the processed ingredients.",
13559,The were already available to the wealthy during ancient times.,
13560,Seminar leader Justine Diemke and (second from right) and Skadi Kull (second from left) answer students’ questions in the laboratory.,
13561,The first attempt resulted in only faint-smelling oil.,
13562,"During the next attempt, students will test whether the ingredients should be infused in the oil longer.",
13563,Universität Hamburg will be promoting interdisciplinary teaching tandems in Winter Semester 2021/22.,
13564,These tandems consist of 2 teachers from different faculties or backgrounds who have together developed an innovative teaching format on the topic of mobility.,
13565,"Here, we introduce one of the projects.",
13566,"Saffron, cinnamon, and rose petals: fragrances were much loved by the wealthy in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire.",
13567,“They were used for much more than just perfume for an individual person.,
13568,"Back then, people deodorized pets, fabrics, entire rooms, and even buildings like theaters, thermae, and libraries,” says Justine Diemke, who heads the course along with a fellow Department of History colleague and another colleague from the Department of Chemistry.",
13569,Diemke is a research associate in the Ancient History subject group and is currently doing her doctorate on the topic of mental illnesses in antiquity.,
13570,"While working with ancient texts, Diemke came across olfactory traces.",
13571,"“There are references about the use of fragrances in many different sources,” Diemke explains.",
13572,"Botanists, doctors, and philosophers from that time wrote about these, passed down recipes, or even criticized the overuse of fragrances.",
13573,"“For instance, Pliny the Elder reported that the Roman emperor Nero had a full year’s harvest of incense burned at the burial of his second wife Poppaea Sabina in 65 CE.",
13574,"This exorbitant use of fragrances was negatively construed,” says Diemke.",
13575,"Individual philosophical schools such as the Stoics and Cynics admonished the use of luxury goods like perfume and, at the same time, were themselves regarded as a less than sweet-smelling group.",
13576,This was hardly surprising: “Many preached material abstinence and called for a simple life.,
13577,"Diogenes of Sinope, born around 413 BCE, was said to have stayed the night in a refuse bin; he is unlikely to have smelled particularly pleasant,” says Diemke.",
13578,"However, we do not have any real idea of how it smelled in ancient times.",
13579,The Greeks and the Romans prepared the ingredients differently from how it is done today.,
13580,"“Today, we extract the fragrances found in plants through distillation—that is, by heating and separating the contained essential oils.",
13581,"Fragrances extracted in this way are intense but also fleeting,” says Skadi Kull, a chemist.",
13582,"“At that time, olive oil was usually infused with ingredients such as rose petals.",
13583,We do not know how strongly this kind of scented oil smelled or how long it retained its fragrance.”,
13584,Experimental imitations of those ancient recipes are the only way to figure out the olfactory reality of that time.,
13585,Obtaining chemical proof of the fragrances used is not possible.,
13586,"“We do not know how long the raw ingredients were infused in the oil or how they were filtered,” explains Diemke.",
13587,“Recipes were indeed passed down but without precise instructions on the processes.”,
13588,"Together with students of ancient history, the teaching tandem wants to produce perfume oils in multiple workshops.",
13589,"In doing so, students will use ingredients that were available in antiquity.",
13590,"In a first run, they infused olive oil with fenugreek, flower petals, and cardamom seeds for just one day.",
13591,The resulting oil smelled only faintly of these ingredients.,
13592,"In their next attempt, they will let the ingredients infuse longer.",
13593,"With this approach, they hope to slowly get closer to creating the best scents.",
13594,Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence is funding 8 teaching tandems in Winter Semester 2021/22 as part of the further development of the Studium Generale.,
13595,"Each teaching tandem will receive up to €6,000 in funding from the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.

13596,"During the Empire, the “temple” on the Mönckebergstraße was still a library.",
13597,A childcare center being expanded in the 1950s.,
13598,The exhibition “Die Zeit war reif—100,
13599,Jahre Bildung und Lernen in Hamburg” has now opened: it takes a look at a century of education and learning in Hamburg.,
13600,The exhibition introduces Hamburg’s 5 large educational institutions and examines what it takes to turn a city into a thriving educational center.,
13601,On 28 March 1919 Hamburg’s Senate resolved to establish a university.,
13602,"This was something new: Throughout the 19th century, only princes and kings had founded universities and Germany had been ruled by a monarchy until 1918.",
13603,"On 28 March, the senators also agreed to create a “Volkshochschule” or adult education center in another pioneering act.",
13604,"Until then, it had not been widely believed that the state should provide adults with opportunities for life-long learning.",
13605,1919—A year of new beginnings for Hamburg In 1919 the Senate further decided to make early childhood education a public obligation.,
13606,"From this point onwards, it generously funded a committee for infant and toddler centers.",
13607,The association was a precursor to today’s Elbkinder childcare centers.,
13608,It became an umbrella organization for over 50 centers that provided care to children with working parents.,
13609,"In the same year, private citizens and senators initiated the Hamburger Volksbühne e.V. (now inkultur—Hamburger Volksbühne e.V.).",
13610,"This society organized affordable theater subscriptions for Hamburg’s citizens, making culture and educational goods accessible to all.",
13611,"Finally, in the same year, all of Hamburg’s private libraries consolidated into a single foundation.",
13612,"This made it possible to better coordinate inventory, economize, and provide Hamburg’s eager readers with more books.",
13613,"“Nineteen-nineteen was a year of new beginnings for the city,” said Dr. Christina Kuhli from the Art History Seminar at Universität Hamburg.",
13614,"“For the first time, a democratically elected parliament and thus a truly democratic Senate convened.",
13615,"By founding or supporting Hamburg’s 5 large educational institutions, it created a basis for the democratic education of its citizens.”",
13616,"Improvising among the rubble Kuhli curated the exhibition in cooperation with colleagues from the Hamburg Adult Education Center, the Elbkinder childcare centers, the libraries, and the inkultur association.",
13617,There are 48 panels of historical photos showing how the “Hamburg Five” have contributed turning Hamburg into a center of education.,
13618,"For example, the University was already a magnet for prominent researchers in the 1920s, attracting the likes of Otto Stern, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize.",
13619,"It was even possible for Hamburg’s citizens to take in some theater in this war-torn city: actors improvised, creating stages out of the ruins.",
13620,"In the second half of the 20th century, there was nary a district in which you couldn’t borrow a book.",
13621,"Today, life in the city is inconceivable without the Hamburg Five.",
13622,"For this reason the Senate is honoring them with an exhibiton at City Hall. 
",
13623,"In Germany, there are many programs that help researchers who face political, religious, or ethnic persecution in their own countries.",
13624,"At Universität Hamburg, Kristin Günther and her team in the Department of International Affairs lend support.",
13625,"In 2016, over 2,000 researchers in Turkey signed a petition to advocate for peace and condemn human rights violations in the country’s Kurdish regions.",
13626,"Rather than bring peace, however, these signatures had drastic consequences for the signatories: more than 500 researchers were fired from their universities.",
13627,"For fear of being ostracized or to avoid court procedures, many of these researchers are trying to continue with their work abroad.",
13628,A few of these researchers have also come to Hamburg to live and work in safety.,
13629,"“As a result of the petition in 2016, we are still receiving most queries from at-risk researchers from Turkey.",
13630,"But people also turn to us from, for example, Belarus, Yemen, Brazil, or, at the moment, Afghanistan,” says Kristin Günther.",
13631,She and her team at Universität Hamburg field these queries and help researchers take their first steps when applying for research grants.,
13632,"To be accepted at Universität Hamburg, researchers need to acquire funding and their risk status needs to be ascertained.",
13633,Both matters are handled in the funding programs set up to support at-risk researchers.,
13634,"Furthermore, a mentor must be prepared to provide academic supervision.",
13635,“The best-known program is the Philip Schwartz Initiative run by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.,
13636,"Unfortunately, the demand from researchers is very big and by no means is every application there successful,” says Günther.",
13637,The initiative targets postdoctoral researchers and offers research grants twice annually for 24 or a maximum of 36 months.,
13638,"There are more programs regionally and internationally, for example, the Hamburg Programme for Scholars at Risk.",
13639,"Furthermore, the DAAD has also introduced its first programs for students and doctoral researchers.",
13640,"Normally, researchers looking for help contact Kristin Günther directly.",
13641,She not only helps applicants fill out forms but also looks for mentors at Universität Hamburg.,
13642,The ultimate goal of these programs is academic integration and the securing of work and research opportunities.,
13643,"“In rare cases, researchers from Universität Hamburg contact us because they already have contact with someone they would like to support.",
13644,"We advise in these cases, too.”",
13645,"The team from the Department of International Affairs are not responsible only for applications, however.",
13646,They also support researchers who have been accepted and come to Hamburg.,
13647,They often contact the German embassies so that researchers can quickly get visa appointments.,
13648,"In Hamburg, the staff accompany researchers to municipal offices, explain letters from the authorities, and organize networking events.",
13649,"“We generally stay in regular contact and also often get to know the researchers personally,” says Günther.",
13650,"Due to limited resources, only one in five applications succeeds, but Günther’s team know that their work is important and they enjoy the feedback from the researchers.",
13651,"And the exchanges are motivating: “Behind every query is a personal destiny and it’s great to help people,” says Günther.

13653,"Mark your calender for some GORE robot soccer action in Hamburg from 27–30 April 2023, including University robots.",
13654,"Hamburg’s players are 82 centimeters tall and play, therefore, in the so-called “Humanoid Kid-Size League.”",
13655,"The robots were trained and set up by the members of the student working group Hamburg Bit-Bots, which was also funded through the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.",
13656,"What makes the robots special is that they compete autonomously, meaning without remote control.",
13657,"In addition to the humanoid league, there is also the “Standard Platform League,” in which all teams use the same type of robot.",
13658,"“RoboCup is a competition to foster robotics research—with a special focus on humanoid robots,” explains Jasper Güldenstein, doctoral researcher in the Department of Informatics and a robot trainer.",
13659,The German Open Replacement Event (GORE) is one of several RoboCup competitions that take place the world over.,
13660,"At GORE, expert commentators explain to the viewers why the robots behave as they do and what is behind the technology.",
13661,This makes the world of RoboCup comprehensible to those not otherwise familiar with robotics.,
13662,"“We are organizing GORE together with the HULKS from the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) and the RoboCup team from TU Dortmund,” says Güldenstein.",
13663,"There are 12 robot teams entering the competition, which will take place in the CFEL building at Luruper Chaussee 149 in Science City Bahrenfeld and is being co-organized by DESY.",
13664,"The event is free and once again, there will be a livestream for those who cannot attend in person.

13670,"At the ceremony to celebrate Universität Hamburg’s 100th anniversary, astronaut Alexander Gerst was made an honorary senator.",
13671,"In return, Gerst presented a University banner that he had taken with him into space.",
13672,"In his speech, he advocated for pioneering exploration.",
13673,"It was the most stirring moment of the celebration ceremony for the University’s 100th anniversary: astronaut Alexander Gerst, who did his doctorate in geophysics in Hamburg, was officially named Honorary Senator of Universität Hamburg.",
13674,"In return, Gerst presented the University with a University banner that he took along on his distant journey to the International Space Station (ISS).",
13675,"He also presented the University’s president, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.",
13676,"Dieter Lenzen, with a plaque from his last space mission, Horizons.",
13677,"These were gifts to a University that had, according to Gerst, profoundly influenced him.",
13678,"It did not simply encourage him to tread a familiar path, but it encouraged him “to go where no one had gone before.”",
13679,Alexander Gerst already showed curiosity and a passion for research when he was studying at Universität Hamburg.,
13680,"Together with his supervisor Prof. Dr. Matthias Hort from the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN), Gerst went on several expeditions, including to the Antarctic and the South Pacific.",
13681,"In 2008, while on Tanna Island, about 2,000 km east of Australia, Gerst found out that he had passed the first application round with the European Space Agency (ESA).",
13682,"One year later, the ESA introduced him as its new astronaut.",
13683,"In May 2017, he took off for the ISS in a Soyuz rocket from a space station in Baikonur (Kazakhstan).",
13684,He was the 11th German citizen in space and the 3rd German citizen on the ISS.,
13685,"Since then, Gerst has completed a second space tour.",
13686,"He is not only the ESA astronaut with the longest total time spent in space (362), but, on his last mission, he also became the first German ISS commander.",
13687,"Almost 10 years ago, the Baden-Württemberg native submitted his dissertation at Universität Hamburg on the Antarctic volcano Mount Erebus.",
13688,"And after his many experiences in space, it is still research that inspires him.",
13689,"“My heart beats for research and I feel at home in this environment,” said Gerst.",
13690,The geophysicist said that he feels most fulfilled when he contributes to knowledge.,
13691,"He would like to continue to do so in the future: “If I have an opportunity and things calm down a bit, I would really like to begin teaching again and to pass on what I had the privilege to experience.”",
13692,"Perhaps he will return to his Alma Mater.
",
13693,Could microorganisms devour and rid the world of microplastics?,
13694,Prof.,
13695,Dr. Wolfgang Streit and his team in the Department of Biology at Universität Hamburg are trying to find out.,
13696,Imagine a tanker leaking oil in the ocean.,
13697,The first to arrive on the scene are the fire department and nature protection organizations for a rudimentary clean-up.,
13698,"When they leave, microorganisms act a bit like nature’s trash collectors.",
13699,They eat the oil and digest it using enzymes.,
13700,"They cannot entirely undo the damage, but they can fix much of it.",
13701,This is roughly what we are thinking with regard to microplastics.,
13702,We can easily collect and dispose of large pieces of plastic waste like bottles or bags.,
13703,"We cannot see, however, the pollution caused by nano- or microplastics.",
13704,We cannot always say where microplastics are or what their material flow is like.,
13705,We know how much industry produces annually but we don’t really know where it ends up.,
13706,Sometimes in the water—in lakes and oceans—but also in the soil.,
13707,There aren’t any current studies that really prove that plastic is toxic or will become so in the years ahead.,
13708,But it’s a possibility.,
13709,Plastic could be a time bomb.,
13710,"Actually, colleagues from the former Society for Biotechnology—now the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig—identified the first plastic-eating bacteria in 1998 (Kleeberg et al., Appl.",
13711,Environ.,
13712,Microbiol.,
13713,1998 64(5):1731-5).,
13714,"Initially they were concerned about commercial matters, not about environmental technology.",
13715,Cellulases are enzymes made up of bacteria.,
13716,They can break down cotton wool threads.,
13717,This is why they are used in detergent: to prevent pilling or the build-up of cotton fuzz on sweaters or pants.,
13718,Detergent manufacturers then looked for similar enzymes for synthetics such as polyester.,
13719,"They found them, but they weren’t strong enough to break down plastic in the natural world.",
13720,They still have very long degradation rates.,
13721,It can take up to 500 years for a plastic bottle in the soil to degrade.,
13722,The bacteria can perhaps break down smaller particles more quickly but we don’t have reliable data on that.,
13723,"Generally, evolutionary processes take place over millions of years.",
13724,But PET and other plastics have only been around for about 60 years.,
13725,"For bacteria, that is too little time to really adapt.",
13726,"Also, PET was designed to last a very long time and not to rot.",
13727,"Nonetheless, we have found plastic-eating bacteria and we are on the search for bacteria with better degradation rates.",
13728,"We ask where in nature there are surfaces similar to plastic and we have identified three places to look more intensively for bacteria: first, on waxy leaves, for example, in the Botanical Gardens; second, near oil reserves, such as in Wietze, where oil is extracted via above-ground tar cooling; and third, Hamburg’s harbor, where ships and human activity have produced oil in no small quantities.",
13729,We analyze the various bacteria at these places.,
13730,"Since we cannot cultivate roughly 99% of these bacteria, we are trying to identify the enzymes necessary for plastic degradation using other, culture-free methods.",
13731,"Concretely, we are looking for so-called PET hydrolases.",
13732,Yes and no.,
13733,The approach will quickly bump into roadblocks.,
13734,The enzymes we have now are so slow that even if they increase by a factor of 10 they won’t be efficient for turning over plastic.,
13735,The basic enzymes have to be more active.,
13736,Enzymes are a very environmentally friendly and safe method.,
13737,"After all, they are not organisms.",
13738,"This is why they are used in other areas, for example for fruit juices, wine, or baked goods like pizzas and bread.",
13739,We could add enzymes to purification plants or detergents.,
13740,"They could also be used in places that have been contaminated by microplastics, or in organic waste collection bins—where plastics end up now and then.",
13741,"You could add an enzyme cocktail to disintegrate the plastic and remove it from the environment.
",
13742,Application is an important part of information technology.,
13743,"To advance applications, the Informatikum at Universität Hamburg runs the creative lab base.camp.",
13744,"With support from the Department of Informatics, students can develop their own programming and software ideas.",
13745,The first projects since base.camp’s founding in October 2018 have now started.,
13746,Universität Hamburg students head to Stellingen when they want to engage in creative programming.,
13747,The district is home to the Department of Informatics’ base.camp creative lab.,
13748,"Students can realize their ideas and projects on Big Data, AI, and security.",
13749,“A project’s usefulness is not one of the main criteria at the very start.,
13750,"It’s about ‘learning by doing,’ about development, and, of course, about learning from failure and how to do it better next time,” said Mathias Fischer, a professor in the Department of Informatics, scientific director of base.camp, and chair of the base.camp steering committee.",
13751,"Aside from Fischer, the steering committee includes Prof. Eva Bittner, Prof. Chris Biermann, and Prof. Judith Simon as well as 2 students.",
13752,The committee reviews project ideas and whether or not projects can be realized within the scope of a few months.,
13753,Then students can get started.,
13754,Eugen Ruppert and Björn Schmidt oversee the creative lab’s operations and lend a helpful hand.,
13755,Twice a week the research associates hold office hours to advise students and contribute their technical and methodological expertise.,
13756,One current project was the brainchild of Thorben Willert.,
13757,He is studying informatics in the fourth semester and has been active in base.camp since December.,
13758,He would like to help consumers of meat products by creating images that show potential buyers how the animals lived.,
13759,"“Products already bear codes but few consumers can really deal with them,” he said.",
13760,“Pictures make it easer to see how animals really live.”,
13761,His idea: Customers can use their Smartphone to scan codes on the product and see pictures.,
13762,"“My goal is to create greater transparency and show what animal life in production facilities really looks like,” Willert said.",
13763,Data would be transmitted via ear-tags.,
13764,Cameras installed at farms would record and integrated software would “read” the information.,
13765,Willert first visited an organic farm near Hamburg and photographed cows in their stable.,
13766,Now he is developing the software that will be able to recognize the codes on the ear-tag photos.,
13767,He will conclude the project by taking videos and having his self-designed software analyze them.,
13768,Willert will decide later whether or not customers need to download an App or simply scan a barcode to see images on a webpage.,
13769,"“It would be great if I could find someone for the project who is more familiar with image processing than I am,” he said.",
13770,The base.camp team also wants to help students find partners.,
13771,Eugen Ruppert and Björn Schmidt are planning a project market at which students can present their ideas and get others on board.,
13772,"Ideally, this will lead to interdisciplinary cooperation, since developing a website involves not just programming but graphic design, among other things.",
13773,"They are also seeking to create closer ties within Hamburg, for example, with other universities.",
13774,Thorben Willert would like to complete his project by summer.,
13775,"Right now, he is working on the software 6–8 hours per week and spending a lot of time in the base.camp lab.",
13776,"Whether his idea will find purchase is not something he can predict but he hopes that, at the least, small or organic farms will seize upon it.

13777,"In 2022, 23 researchers at Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence will receive funding from the Ideas and Venture Fund.",
13778,The researchers will use this to prepare third-party-funded projects suited to one of the University’s profile initiatives or emerging fields.,
13779,"In total, the University will have around €842,000 at its disposal.",
13780,"Here, we introduce 3 projects.",
13781,Prof. Dr. Esther Diekhof: Why do some people get sick while others don’t?,
13782,"When surrounded by people with an infectious disease, not everyone gets sick.",
13783,Some remain puzzlingly free from infection.,
13784,This previously mysterious phenomenon is the subject of investigation by human biologist and neuroscientist Esther Diekhof and her team.,
13785,"“We have found considerable indications that certain immune defenses respond to visual cues, even before direct contact with an infected person.",
13786,"If these mechanisms respond pro-actively to the mere sight of a person who is sick, then their host is probably well-protected from infection,” explains the junior professor from Universität Hamburg.",
13787,"Now, equipped with €26,000 from the Ideas and Venture Fund, Prof. Diekhof is looking for answers.",
13788,"She wants to create films and photographs of people who are visibly ill, and then show these to a range of test subjects.",
13789,"While doing this, she measures the cognitive response to this stimuli, the release of antibodies in saliva and the brain activity of her test subjects using MRI scans.",
13790,"“Ideally, this way, we will not only get further evidence for the preventative activation of the immune system through purely visual stimulation, but also find evidence of which areas of the brain are involved in the immune process, and why this mechanism varies in strength from person to person,” she explains.",
13791,"Should her preliminary study proceed well, she is planning to make a larger application for more funding from the DFG to further her research.",
13792,Her proposed research is based in the emerging field of Infection Research at Universität Hamburg.,
13793,Everyone knows what emotions are—until they have to define them.,
13794,"So runs the joke, well-known in the world of psychology, but, as with all jokes, there is a grain of truth to it: we still do not have a generally applicable definition of emotions.",
13795,"Beyond this, there are many questions still open in terms of human emotions: What is more likely to trigger emotions: general issues, concrete things, or specific situations?",
13796,How to emotions amplify in groups of people?,
13797,Or why does a specific trigger cause different emotions in different people?,
13798,"“To develop effective intervention methods, we first need to understand exactly what emotions are.",
13799,"That is the only way we can, for example, provide long-term assistance to people suffering from depression, or prevent extreme, previously mysterious phenomena such as mass panic,” explains Dr. Jens Lange, research assistant at the Institute for Psychology.",
13800,"With the almost €4,000 from Universität Hamburg’s Ideas and Venture Fund, they are intending to show test subjects a range of videos of natural catastrophes, and examine whether they trigger the same emotions at the same time, and how that works exactly.",
13801,They also want to survey test subjects about their current feelings at different times throughout their everyday activities.,
13802,"In so doing, he is testing an experiment design that, if it works, will be an important component of externally funded research, for example as part of an ERC Starting Grant.",
13803,https://www.eubuero.de/erc-stg.htm Dr. Lange’s research is based in the University’s profile initiative Mechanisms of Change.,
13804,"European languages had not been standardized in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries.",
13805,"There were—even in German—no fixed rules, no Duden (the standard German dictionary), and no binding grammar rules as we know them today.",
13806,"Prof. Dr. Filatkina Dr. Hübner “We know how educated people expressed themselves, through their writing, but how ordinary people thought about language, how they imagined good German or good French, is much less well-known,” explains Prof. Dr. Natalia Filatkina.",
13807,"Working with Dr. Julia Hübner, she will now investigate this question, using 500 foreign language works.",
13808,"Tradesmen, poorer members of the nobility, and other travelers used these books to learn foreign languages.",
13809,"“They were cheaply produced language guides, printed on very thin paper, designed to be carried in your pocket.",
13810,"They did however contain sample dialogs, which tell us a lot about the use of language at the time.",
13811,explains Filatkina.,
13812,"The researchers are using almost €50,000 from the Ideas and Venture Fund to prepare a long-term research proposal: They are looking through suitable works, to establish their rules, conduct full-text digital scans, and break down the texts according to specific characteristics.",
13813,"“This is the requirement for using these previously underutilized sources objectively for future research, and obtaining verifiable research results from them,” explains Filatkina.",
13814,"If the planned external funding comes through, the project should go for at least 12 years.",
13815,"The Ideas and Venture Fund was created as part of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.

13816,Black hole in the Messier 87,
13817,Galaxy It has not previously been possible to photograph a black hole.,
13818,This is how researchers imagined a black hole before the first photo was taken.,
13819,The international research project Event Horizon has now succeeded in photographing a black hole for the first time.,
13820,"But what is a black hole, actually, and what does it do?",
13821,"We’ve asked Prof. Dr. Jochen Liske from the Sternwarte, Universität Hamburg’s observatory.",
13822,"A black hole is an object with such immense gravity that nothing that gets near it can ever escape it: if something “falls in,” it will never come back out.",
13823,This is even true of light.,
13824,"To illustrate this, let’s first think about our own Earth.",
13825,There is a certain gravity working upon Earth’s surface.,
13826,"For example, if you throw a tennis ball straight up into the air, it reaches a certain height before falling back to the ground.",
13827,This depends upon the initial speed.,
13828,"The greater the initial speed, the higher the ball will go.",
13829,"If the initial speed is more than 11.2 km/s (roughly 40,320 km/h), the ball would not come down again: it would escape Earth’s gravitational pull.",
13830,"This special initial speed is called “escape velocity,” a descriptive measurement for the force of gravity.",
13831,The force of an object’s gravity depends on both its mass and its size.,
13832,"If Earth were smaller but had the same mass, its escape velocity would be much bigger.",
13833,"If it were the size of a pea, Earth’s escape velocity would equal the speed of light.",
13834,"Since nothing can move faster than light, then nothing would be able to escape the surface of this pea-sized Earth and we would have a black hole.",
13835,Albert Einstein had already predicted black holes.,
13836,"It only became possible to prove their existence much later, however, based on astrophysical observations: for example, years-long observation of the movement of stars or proof of gravitational waves.",
13837,"As far as we know, black holes only exist in the far reaches of the Universe.",
13838,"We are aware of black holes of varying size or mass, what we call “stellar black holes,” which have roughly the mass of a few suns; a solar mass is 1.99 quadrillion tons.",
13839,"These black holes are the remains of huge, extinguished stars.",
13840,"They can be found all over our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and presumably, they can be found in all other galaxies.",
13841,"However, there are so few of these holes that we don’t have to be afraid that one of them is going to sweep through our solar system tomorrow.",
13842,"Furthermore, we also know of supermassive black holes with a solar mass of millions or even billions.",
13843,"These, however, only appear in the center of galaxies—and in the center of our Milky Way.",
13844,"The impact of a black hole lies in its enormous gravitational pull, although that only plays a role if you get too close to it.",
13845,"Observed from afar, the impact of a black hole does not differ at all from the impact of a normal object with the same mass.",
13846,"For example, if the sun collapses into a black hole tomorrow, it would have no effect on the orbits of the planets in our solar system, since these are determined by the sun’s gravitational pull.",
13847,"If, however, you get to close, things can get dicey.",
13848,The hole is just a point surrounded by what is known as the “event horizon.”,
13849,"If something, let’s say a rocket, traverses this, it can’t return.",
13850,"There are also enormous tidal waves near the horizon, comparable to those responsible for the ebb and tide on Earth, and these would rip everything apart.",
13851,"By measuring the movement of matter in the immediate vicinity of a black hole, we can draw conclusions about the nature of the black hole as well as check the validity of Albert Einstein’s predictions.

13852,"As part of the funding of transfer projects, Universität Hamburg has created the special program format “Mehr Weitblick nach der Coronavirus-Krise”; (a broader perspective after the corona crisis).",
13853,"Thirteen projects will each receive up to €10,000 for research focusing on the novel coronavirus and its effects on health, the economy, and society, in the search for ways out of the crisis.",
13854,The funds come from the Excellence Initiative of the Federal and State Governments.,
13855,"Here, we introduce 3 projects: The march of the novel coronavirus through Germany has made many feel very insecure, particularly when it comes to dealing with those who are sick or have died.",
13856,"For example, what does it mean for members of staff in hospitals, in churches, or in funeral homes?",
13857,Are the bodies of the victims contagious?,
13858,How significant is the danger?,
13859,And how can one protect oneself?,
13860,"These are fundamental questions, for which we have yet to find satisfactory answers.",
13861,"Similarly, we do not know if it is really necessary to isolate the bodies of those who have died of or with Covid-19, or if their families can see them once more before the funeral.",
13862,"Antonia Fitzek, assistant doctor in her third year of studies at the Institute of Legal Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf doubts the need for current practice.",
13863,“The virus is transfered via droplets.,
13864,I don’t see a conclusive risk of infection only from looking at or touching a person who has died.”,
13865,she said.,
13866,"To get some much needed clarity on this point, she is researching whether traces of the virus can be found on deceased persons who tested positive for Covid-19 prior to their death.",
13867,"Her goal: “We take samples from the skin of deceased person, from the body bags used to transport them, and the coffins, from every surface that is often touched.”",
13868,she explained.,
13869,"By the end of the year, she will have conducted these tests on every person who has died in Hamburg with or from Covid-19.",
13870,"The tests and the distribution of survey forms to Hamburg funeral homes and church communities are paid for with €10,000 funding from Universität Hamburg.",
13871,Fitzek hopes to use the surveys to identify open questions and suggestions for improvement drawn from practice.,
13872,"So far, she has tested 8 cases, all with negative results.",
13873,She emphasizes that “the number of cases tested is still too small to make a generally useful statement.”,
13874,"But, the initial results are reassuring.",
13875,"Global trade has suffered markedly during the coronavirus pandemic, sometimes with dramatic results.",
13876,"In particular, the supply of medical equipment, PPE, and medicines fell short of demand.",
13877,"That is because there are very few, if any, countries who produce all the products they need to care for their populations and combat SARS-CoV-2.",
13878,"For example, Germany specialized in the production of medical devices, while PPE must be imported from China or Malaysia.",
13879,"Using the example of medical equipment, economist Prof.",
13880,"Qing Liu from the Faculty of Business Administration is examining the flow of products between Germany and China during the crisis, with a particularly close look at the forms of transport used.",
13881,"As many ports were closed, sea freight, which usually transports more than 90 percent of goods traded globally, was severely restricted.",
13882,"Costs in air transport exploded, as passenger flights reduced dramatically, thereby also reducing the amount of goods that could be transported on board passenger aircraft.",
13883,Only rail transport seems to have profited.,
13884,"The number of trains running from the People’s Republic of China as far as Duisburg in the spring of 2020, along what is referred to as the New Silk Road, increased significantly.",
13885,"In her research project, Prof. Liu will bring together the data on trade in medical goods using air and sea transport as well as rail.",
13886,"“The results should let us act proactively should we have a second wave, or any other kind of crisis.",
13887,We live in a connected world that is dependent on trade.”,
13888,says Prof. Liu.,
13889,"The funding, amounting to €10,000, will go toward paying for academic staff and to bring the data required together.",
13890,"Their research report will be made accessible to everyone over the internet, and live talks and presentations are also being planned.",
13891,"Fundamental crises, like the current Covid-19 health crisis, change living conditions and can also shift human needs.",
13892,Measuring these shifts is challenging.,
13893,Crises are only rarely able to be identified in advance.,
13894,"As a result, there is a lack of appropriate psychometric testing prior to, during, and after a crisis.",
13895,Prof. Dr. Mark Heitmann and his team are therefore drawing on historical data for online-searches.,
13896,His assumption is that changes in human needs will result in changes to their internet searches.,
13897,"As a result of the current Covid-19 crisis, he and his team are developing a methodology to connect daily search behavior with changes in human needs.",
13898,"“We still don’t know much about whether needs change during a crisis, or how.” explains Mark Heitmann, Professorship for Marketing and Customer Insight at the Faculty of Business Administration.",
13899,"“But it is relevant, as our existence as a society and our social economy ultimately exist to satisfy human needs.",
13900,"Only when we understand these needs can we find the right services and products, and implement appropriate political measures.”",
13901,"To inform the public about his research findings, Prof. Heitmann is publishing in both academic and specialist-practice magazines.",
13902,The process they have developed has resulted in international start-ups that now employ hundreds of people.,
13903,"The €9,000 funding will go towards funding representative studies, appropriately coding the comprehensive amount of data, and the analysis of this material using modern machine-learning processes.

13916,He does this by using insights into the fascinating world behind the scenes of professional soccer.,
13917,Infection researcher Prof. Dr. Marylin Addo addresses a very current topic one week later on 14 November:,
13918,"Warum ein kleiner Piks gegen ansteckende Krankheiten hilft (Why a little pinprick can help against infectious disease) Together with the audience, she looks at why certain infectious diseases can spread so quickly across the world, how they are treated, and what role vaccination plays.",
13919,"The second half of the Audimax lectures begins on 21 November with the historian Prof. Dr. Philippe Depreux, who takes us on a little trip back to about 1200 years ago.",
13920,"At the time, Charlemagne ruled over what is now Germany, France, Italy and other countries as well.",
13921,Depreux explains who this great emperor was and what he meant for history in the lecture Wem gehört Karl der Große?,
13922,(Who owns Charlemagne?).,
13923,"Finally, meteorologist Dr. Hartmut Borth provides some insights into the climate sciences.",
13924,"Often, climate change is hard to grasp, but his lecture Unsere Atmosphäre: Schutzhülle, Klimaanlage und Wasserautobahn (Our atmosphere: protective shield, air conditioning, and water highways) makes it easy to see how we can use climate models and super computers to understand how our atmosphere, and thus the weather, will change in the future, and what that will mean for humankind.",

13947,His speech was a clear commitment to Hamburg as a center of science and scholarship.,
13948,"In contrast to the situation in 1913, as the Hamburg city assembly rejected the proposal to establish a university with recourse to Hamburg\s genius lopsidedness as a city of merchants, today it is clear that being a strong business location is not just a decorative accessory for a major modern international city, but a prerequisite for innovation, economic growth and solutions to global challenges.

13991,"Now, she will be researching in the Hanseatic City of Hamburg for 10 months.",
13992,"The legal philosopher Dietmar von der Pfordten, her fellow resident, is professor of philosophy of law and social philosophy at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.",
13993,"He has written a book on human rights for the Wissen series of the C.H.Beck publishing house and regularly takes up matters like abortion, gene technology, and euthanasia.",
13994,He wants to use his time in Hamburg to finish another book.,
13995,"“It will be a kind of opus magnum, a compendium of my knowledge of the nature of law,” he explains.",
13996,"“As an advanced fellow, I can concentrate soley on my work.",
13997,"In day-to-day life at university, between professorial duties and committees, there is little time for such pursuits.”",
13998,"Knowledge transfer is an explicit goal of the fellowships, despite not being currently fully implemented as a result of the pandemic.",
13999,"However, Sophia Prinz is still planning workshops—for next year.",
14000,"She is hoping that she herself can then visit museums and exhibitions again: as she is working at the interface of research and art, contact with the Hamburg art and culture scene is important for her.",
14001,"Dietmar van der Pfordten, in contrast, is looking to get involved in the Hanseatic city’s political culture.",
14002,"Its long, peaceful history fascinates him, and he would like to know more about the mentality that prevails here.",
14003,"He is relaxed about the fact that nothing much on the political stage is going to plan right now, pointing out, “I’m staying in Hamburg until next summer, so there is still hope!”
",
14004,"Whether a tutor, an employee in the administration, or a student research assistant—Universität Hamburg offers a lot of possibilities for gaining professional experience alongside your studies.",
14005,Students support work processes in all areas and get a glimpse behind the scenes.,
14006,"Three of them take a look at their own experiences below.
",
14007,"As part of the EU-funded Improving Quality of Care in Europe (IQCE) European Training Network, a total of 15 doctoral candidates from all over the world are developing concepts to improve the European healthcare system.",
14008,"Six European partner universities are offering the program, including Universität Hamburg (Hamburg Health Center for Health Economics).",
14009,Angela Meggiolaro is one of the 4 students being supervised here.,
14010,My topic focuses on the development of a standardized econometric method to evaluate quality and costs of healthcare in different countries by using statistical data and methods.,
14011,I will focus on one emergency treatment in case of cardiovascular diseases and stroke treatment.,
14012,I will try to measure hospital performancein different countries.,
14013,"In other words: Do the German hospitals perform better than Italian, English, or other European hospitals?",
14014,To do that I have to develop measurable criteria für quality.,
14015,On the other hand are the costs.,
14016,"We will also compare the public expenditures and we will try to forecast a country’s outcome at different budget constraint, if data allow.",
14017,"Throughout my career, especially during my clinical practice as a medical doctor, I have experienced the impact of diagnoses and treatments at the patient level.",
14018,"However, previous and current health research still provides poor evidence to health policymakers in many circumstances.",
14019,The rationale of the IQCE program is to support research with the potential to influence health policy to improve the quality of healthcare in Europe—within a context of limited resources and competing demands.,
14020,"I was personally attracted by the international profile of the program, and the opportunity for collaboration with highly qualified PhD candidates.",
14021,The prospect of learning from internationally recognized specialists thrilled and challenged me at the same time.,
14022,"Moreover, the IQCE training takes place at some of the best European universities in the health economics field, and the training is cutting-edge.",
14023,Each fellow has a home institution where we work on our dissertations.,
14024,In my case that is Universität Hamburg.,
14025,The PhD fellows are offered a range of courses held at all universities associated with the ETN.,
14026,"Different ETN students select specific courses expected to be helpful for their PhD project, but so far we have mostly attended all the classes together.",
14027,"The candidates travel together to the partner university holding the course of interest, enjoying good opportunities to network.",
14028,"The courses are intensive, lasting on average 3–4 days full-time and the students receive a final assessment, usually a take-home exam, to be done in the weeks following the class.",
14029,"In order to collect the credits its mandatory to pass the assessment., For research purposes the biggest problems are not due to a lack of administrative data but of clinical data, for example on the urgent treatments and the preventive healthcare management strategy after discharge from the hospital.",
14030,"Although the German health system is certainly a good example of accountability and transparency, in light of clinical data limitations, it turns out to be difficult to fully compare clinical practices in terms of cost-effectiveness.",
14031,So we try to cooperate with people in the clinical and economic fields as closely as we can.,
14032,"Furthermore, healthcare provision within and between countries in Europe is very heterogeneous.",
14033,The level of inequality still presents significant challenges.,
14034,Regarding my research project:to implement the methodology and compare different countries performance.,
14035,"In terms of the ETN program, I am focusing on multilevel modelling and applied econometrics.",
14036,My research is currently trying to disentangle several methodological issues to produce robust and reliable results.,
14037,"]
",
14038,What conditions do capital markets require and which instruments can make them more predictable?,
14039,"These are a few of the research topics in the focus area of finance, banking, and insurance at the Faculty of Business Administration.",
14040,Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Drobetz provides some insight into current research on the Doing the Research series.,
14041,"Capital markets play central economic roles in a national economy, whereby corporations, with their financing needs, and investors, with their investing wishes, are brought together in efficient ways.",
14042,"When that works well, capital markets foster innovation, change, and growth.",
14043,"Thus, the goal of our research is to understand how available investment resources can be distributed purposefully to those companies that have the most promising projects and the greatest potential for growth and success.",
14044,Capital markets have always been subject to many influences and thus they are susceptible to fluctuation.,
14045,"In times of structural change and disruptive innovations in society and the economy, for example, the transformation to more sustainable technologies, they still have a key role in societies because they require large investments.",
14046,"With our understanding of connections and influences, we can help to create the necessary frameworks and highlight the possible courses of action for companies and investors.",
14047,This will also facilitate better predictions and timely interference.,
14048,"In several current projects, we are examining the use of machine learning in portfolio management.",
14049,"Algorithms are being trained to find patterns in very large data sets and, on the basis of this analysis, to make the best decisions.",
14050,The algorithm can learn free from widespread assumptions about stock market correlations.,
14051,"For example, we should be able to reliably predict returns on individual stocks and even stock market crashes.",
14052,"Against the backdrop of the discussions about social security benefits being covered by capital markets, for example, these kinds of predictions play a central role for the long-term development of pension portfolios.",
14053,"To make these predictions, we almost always work empirically; this means using large amounts of data and statistical or econometric methods.",
14054,We are not just looking at Germany; we also cooperate internationally in our research projects.,
14055,"With machine learning, we do, indeed, use this publicly available information.",
14056,But we assume that there is also informal knowledge on the financial markets.,
14057,"This is why, in another project, we are looking at the influence of investor networks on the success of company takeovers.",
14058,"Institutional investors, such as fund management companies, insurance providers, or retirement funds, have better access to corporate information than small investors do and usually invest in numerous companies at the same time.",
14059,This leads to networks that improve the flow of information and thus the possibility for control over the company.,
14060,"The ownership structure and especially the connections of the owners among one another are, therefore, factors in the company’s success on the takeover market.
",
14061,Hamburg’s harbor is the largest sea port in Germany and the third largest in Europe.,
14062,Increasing costs and competition alongside climate protection concerns are creating major challenges.,
14063,A research group at the Institute of Information Systems is now developing a digital twin for the port in its TwinSim project.,
14064,Project head Dr. Leonard Heilig explains how this can help plan container terminals in more reliable and environmentally friendly ways.,
14065,Our series Doing the Research introduces research projects at Universität Hamburg.,
14066,"Basically, it focuses on the development of a digital twin—meaning the depiction of the physical properties of a container terminal and all its operations in the digital world.",
14067,"We are working together with the EUROGATE container terminal in Hamburg and gathering data on site, such as the position and speed of vehicles, which can then be visually depicted in 3D. Information has to flow well in both directions: the digital twin should interpret received data and use them to make decisions.",
14068,"These, in turn, influence real objects and processes.",
14069,"For this to work, we use different technologies and methods such as sensors and artificial intelligence (AI).",
14070,Container terminals are important hubs in global supply chains and they can quickly become bottlenecks.,
14071,"To make operations run more efficiently and in the long term, we need to make them more transparent.",
14072,"The use of modern technologies yields data with which we can precisely understand and steer equipment, infrastructure, activities, and procedures.",
14073,"On the basis of these data, the digital twin can use simulations in combination with AI procedures to, on the one hand, analyze past operations and, on the other, make predictions so that in each and every situation plans and procedures can be adjusted.",
14074,"For example, if a ship is delayed, the impact can be analyzed pro-actively using a so-called “what-if analysis” and machine learning so that appropriate measures can be taken.",
14075,"On the whole, this ensures better use of resources and we can reduce the negative ecological impact by, for example, avoiding empty shipments or adjusting speed.",
14076,"Operations between water and land can be improved in the long term, also taking into account the vicissitudes and problems in logistic chains.",
14077,We can ensure better use of resources and lower negative impact on the environment.,
14078,"Our research group is looking, first of all, at the simulation-based optimization of transport and storage operations in the container terminal itself.",
14079,"To do so, we first have to analyze procedures and rules at the terminal and depict these using simulation and optimization models in order to develop special procedures.",
14080,We do not just use simulations of certain situations to analyze these procedures; we also compare them to other procedures that have already been used without intelligent planning.,
14081,Other foci are data analysis and the development and application of machine learning procedures.,
14082,"In this case, the concern is recognizing patterns and connections in the large amount of data created by the twin and which increases by the second so that we can derive findings and make predictions.",
14083,"One example is data on equipment, which is crucial to maintenance.",
14084,"These are regularly provided and we can analyze them using the digital twin, for example, to predict when a vehicle or container bridge cannot be used and to undertake preventive maintenance.",
14085,"For me personally it is, above all, designing the digital twin, which involves combining different technologies, approaches, and procedures and thereby, hopefully, creating a useful tool to better address the various challenges posed by container terminals in the future.",
14086,"As a research group, we can use the entire scope of our expertise, learn by doing, generate knowledge, and ultimately make an important contribution.",
14087,The application and evaluation of the digital twin that we develop will first occur at the EUROGATE container terminal in Hamburg.,
14088,"The project, and especially our application-oriented research, is not simply self-serving; it should lead to a tool that can be put into operation daily to improve procedures.",
14089,"To this end, it is important to have the later users, management, and board members involved and to regularly include them.",
14090,"At the start of the project we already held workshops with all of the players and developed procedures to document and evaluate the cases in which you would use the applications and the requirements in the various areas of the enterprise, especially in the different container terminals.",
14091,The knowledge gained in Hamburg’s port will be documented and made available.,
14092,"Later, further container terminals in the EUROGATE group will be equipped.",
14093,"Throughout the project, we will present interim findings internally or at trade fairs and conferences so that anyone interested can stay up-to-date while we foster discussion and stay agile with regard to newly arising requirements.
",
14094,Why should future teachers go abroad during their studies if they are going to teach at a German school afterwards?,
14095,The Faculty of Education’s Tricontinental Teacher Training project answers these questions and explores other benefits.,
14096,Our series Doing the Research introduces research projects at Universität Hamburg.,
14097,"In the Tricontinental Teacher Training (TTT) project, Hamburg-based students visit partner universities either in Ghana or the United States for several weeks.",
14098,"Afterwards, students from those 2 countries come to Hamburg.",
14099,"Throughout the program’s 9-month duration, participants also visit reflection seminars, engage in virtual and in-person exchange, and gain both academic and school-based experience during their period abroad.",
14100,But what do these trainee teachers learn that will help them professionally?,
14101,"The TTT project creates a structure in which teachers can engage with the sense of uncertainty in other languages and cultural spaces, with prejudice and different views, and with ideals and shared notions of being.",
14102,The exchange program aims to stimulate educational moments and professionalization processes that are not possible in seminars.,
14103,"In this video (in English with German subtitles), we show how the TTT project works and how the research team from the 3 participating countries works together.
",
14104,What meaning do humans attach to the behavior of others?,
14105,The TrackingMinds project team under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Sebastian Gluth in the research group Experimental Psychology are looking at how we estimate strangers and their decisions.,
14106,"In the interview below, Gluth explains how they research these processes and why some people are quick to say “yes.”",
14107,"One of the basic ideas of our project is that we human beings use our thinking systems, that we also use for making our own decisions, to interpret what other people do.",
14108,We also presume that other people think the way we do.,
14109,"Previous research has shown, for example, that egotistical people see others as egotistical while people who are altruistic and share a lot expect others to behave similarly.",
14110,This is where our research begins and we conduct controlled lab experiments in which first the test subjects have to make decisions: they have X amount of money and they choose how to divide it between themselves and another anonymous person.,
14111,"In one case, they get more, in the other case, the anonymous person gets more.",
14112,We first measure their behavior and assume that an egotistical person would choose to give him or herself more.,
14113,Exactly.,
14114,We then show test subjects the decision-making processes of other people and they should decide how egotistical or altruistic these other people are.,
14115,They are already familiar with the task because they have performed it themselves.,
14116,The important thing is that they receive different information.,
14117,"In part, they see what the other person chose; in part, however, only how long the person needed to make the decision.",
14118,Several situations need to be evaluated successively and we look at whether test subjects learn to judge the decision-making of other people and which factors or information they use and need to do so.,
14119,Our data so far have suggested that people are surprisingly good at learning to judge others.,
14120,That even works when you see how long a person needs to make a decision and not just what they chose.,
14121,Yes.,
14122,"To better understand thinking processes in the brain at the level of neurons, we supplement our experiments with magnetic resonance tomography or EEGs.",
14123,"For example, here we see activating patterns in the brain when we make our own decisions and we can compare those with the signals when judging others.",
14124,"In this way, we want to find out whether test subjects mentally simulate the behavior of other people to interpret their decisions.",
14125,"We are conducting basic research and the goal is, above all, to create a model of processes by which we judge strangers and anticipate their decisions.",
14126,"In the future, we would like to use this to develop a computer program that interacts with people and learns to improve the communication between people and machines.",
14127,"So far, machine learning is based, of course, on which decision is made at the end—A or B.",
14128,But there is more information in our behavior and we would like to train AI such it can recognize and take into account these other factors.,
14129,The project is dynamic so we can add further questions.,
14130,"In our project, we are looking for the first time at the decision-making time but of course there are other behavioral factors that are relevant.",
14131,"For example, we want to incorporate eye movements.",
14132,They provide clues as to which information people even take on board.,
14133,"And because this kind of project is so dynamic, we could use the insights gained for further queries.",
14134,"Facial expressions, utterances such as sighs or other reactions could thus also be very interesting.",
14135,"Unfortunately, yes, and that is also interesting, of course, from this perspective.",
14136,But in our project it is not important.,
14137,"This kind of research, decision-making neuroscience, is at the junction of neuroscience, psychology, and economics.",
14138,"In marketing, it could be interesting to make use of these findings, for example to determine a customer’s interest in a product based on the time the customer focuses on it and then specifically seeks it—even if the customer doesn’t buy it right away.",
14139,Now and then there are situations that attract my attention and I ask myself if I can use it.,
14140,"For example, when I play cards and I see how long the other player considers a move and whether that helps me determine how good the opponent’s card is.",
14141,"When I want to explain why I research, I like to use the example of a wedding.",
14142,"When the bride and bridegroom are asked to say “I do,” the speed with which the “I do” is uttered is significant.",
14143,"If there is hesitation, the observer immediately asks if the person is uncertain.",
14144,But I was also at a wedding where the bride basically said “I do” before the presiding official had even asked the question.,
14145,"You need to know that people are definitely attuned to the fact that their reaction time is being observed and they use it for so-called “signaling,” that is the quick decision sends a signal about how certain they are.
",
14146,"[ Between 1890 and 1920, the artist couple Ida and Richard Dehmel corresponded with renowned artists such as Stefan Zweig, Rainer Maria Rilke, Else Lasker-Schüler, and Arnold Schönberg.",
14147,"Prof. Dr. Julia Nantke is researching the 35,000 handwritten documents in her project Dehmel Digital and making them publicly available.",
14148,Our series Doing the Research introduces research projects at Universität Hamburg.,
14149,"Many cultural aficionados interested in the Dehmel’s exciting life at the center of modern art around 1900 visit the Dehmelhaus, a memorial site in the Blankenese district of Hamburg.",
14150,"Currently, however, they can only admire the “shell”—the house itself and its furnishings, which give only an inkling of the original atmosphere.",
14151,"Their letters, however, bring their personal network, their interests, their shared projects, and even their parties to life.",
14152,"Thus, we are planning to bring their letters to the Dehmelhaus.",
14153,"Anyone who sees one of Peter Behrens’ pictures on the wall there, for example, can then read letters from Behrens directly, in which he sends the Dehmels his design proposals.",
14154,"Actually, we are not even really scanning them in this project.",
14155,"We are already receiving the digital versions from our project partner, the State and University Library Carl von Ossietzky.",
14156,"We will make these digital documents readable for the general public using computer-based procedures and then identify the people, places, works, and organizations named in them.",
14157,"To do do, we are using various machine-learning procedures because that is faster and more efficient.",
14158,We will feed the findings into the University’s research data repository.,
14159,"At the same time, we will present the parts we have analyzed on the dehmel-digital.de portal already available online in a beta version and which we will regularly update with new material.",
14160,"Definitely the sheer amount of material and thus the necessity of developing a new procedure to study it: 35,000 letters can no longer be handled using classic approaches to study and publishing, which are based on thorough interpretation and manual processing of each and every letter.",
14161,"That’s why in this case we are treading new paths with machine learning, which, in turn, poses its own challenges.",
14162,"We will be using statistical, computer-based procedures to transcribe the handwritten letters (Handwritten Text Recognition—HTR) and to identify the relevant entities such as people and places (Named Entity Recognition—NER).",
14163,There is thus always a certain margin of error for the findings.,
14164,"We will, of course, make corrections but managing the amount and ensuring precision will be a balancing act.",
14165,"Without the statistical procedure, we couldn’t even begin trying to deal with such a large quantity of material.",
14166,We are using supervised machine learning.,
14167,"The algorithms learn to recognize the handwriting and people, places, works, etc. using training data that we supply.",
14168,"For this, we have correctly digitalized a few handwritten letters ourselves.",
14169,"Using these examples, the artificial neuronal network learns the “rules” for translating the handwriting in a transcript.",
14170,"For example, we are concerned with the various forms a letter can take and how it connected to the various previous and subsequent letters, whereby we always check to ensure that prior training data are not simply memorized but that the rules are actually “understood.”",
14171,"As our project clearly shows, without the statistical procedure, we couldn’t even begin to deal with such a large quantity of material.",
14172,"Digital humanities procedures make it possible to look at the entire archival collection rather than just a part of the corpus, and thereby to make the entire network of people and organizations in the background visible for posterity.",
14173,"And when it comes to presentation, the digital format is very advantageous because it’s hardly possible to publish 35,000 letters in printed volumes.",
14174,"On our online portal, we can make the material available to users in a structured way, using illustrations, linked registers, and structured searches and, if necessary, allow them to download individual letters, larger excerpts in the corpus, or the entire collection as an XML to work on further.",
14175,"It is especially exciting to see from the correspondence the collaboration involved in literary and artistic work and in the cultural sector, with constant dialog between colleagues: drafts of poems and sketches are sent back and forth, commented on, and in some cases, worked upon further by correspondence partners.",
14176,"The letters reveal Richard Dehmel’s advocacy for the fair payment of poets, which he attempted to achieve alongside other poets such as Arno Holz and Detlev von Liliencron by founding the Cartel of Lyric Authors, as surely as they reveal Ida Dehmel’s alliance with Rosa Schapire in the Women’s League for the Promotion of the German Visual Arts.
",
14177,"Researchers are not only developing technologies for autonomous cars, but also for vessels used for inland waterway shipping.",
14178,"But until now, no model has taken into account all the different economic and political factors involved in introducing such autonomous vessels.",
14179,The team around Prof. Dr. Qing Liu and Lingyu Zhang want to change that and create a basis for scientific evaluation.,
14180,"In our Doing the Research series, they describe their research project.",
14181,Liu:,
14182,"At the moment, researchers are developing technologies for autonomous vessels used for inland waterway shipping.",
14183,"Experts expect water shipping to become more attractive – and thereby reducing demand for rail and road transportation –, assuming the new technology brings cost savings, safety enhancements, emission reductions, or other benefits.",
14184,"However, without a solid economic model, such expectations cannot be scientifically evaluated prior to implementation.",
14185,So the primary goal of our project is to establish a freight transport model dedicated to autonomous inland shipping in Europe.,
14186,Environmental effects will also be evaluated.,
14187,Liu:,
14188,It is.,
14189,"Autonomous vessels are still very new to the market, so there is very little data for transport and logistics companies to decide whether investment is worthwhile.",
14190,"And there are many different factors to consider, for example, delivery times, environmental impacts, and the level of service.",
14191,Would they choose inland waterway shipping over trains or trucks if they could lower carbon dioxide emissions by ten percent?,
14192,And what should government policies such as subsidies look like?,
14193,"To efficiently and successfully introduce inland autonomous vessels, we need a scientific foundation and a model that considers all the different factors, allowing us to evaluate possible combinations of different transportation modes.",
14194,Zhang:,
14195,The first step is to conduct surveys in the form of interviews and questionnaires.,
14196,"Through them, we will gain a thorough understanding of the market, such as general concerns, challenges, shipment demands, etc.",
14197,"We will interview representatives of European ship owners and service providers such as Hapag-Lloyd, Kühne + Nagel, and TS LINES.",
14198,"Second, based on the information from our surveys, we will establish economic models to analyze changes in demand for different transportation modes, such as rail and road, with the implementation of inland autonomous vessels.",
14199,"And we will also use simulations and develop a suitable approach for evaluating carbon emissions from inland waterway shipping, taking account of autonomous and non-autonomous shipping.",
14200,Zhang:,
14201,"Our project includes seven EU universities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.",
14202,"Since our research is so closely related to shipping practice, we are collaborating with two high-technology companies and the non-university research institute, Institute of International Transport Law (IDIT).",
14203,"In addition to academic publications, we will share our reports and information with the public and the various stakeholders.
",
14204,Dr. Bernhard Schirg and his team in the Public History research group study the stories that people tell about landscapes.,
14205,"The basis for their work is the 4-volume Atlantica by the Swedish scholar Olof Rudbeck (1630–1702), who not only traced Atlantis but all of ancient mythology to Sweden.",
14206,Our series Doing the Research introduces research projects at Universität Hamburg.,
14207,"This enormous tome by Rudbeck—he was a Swedish anatomist, botanist, and university scholar—was a media sensation in the seventeenth century because he brought together thousands of pages in Latin and Swedish, including 500 woodcuts and illustrations of antiquities, rune stones, and much more.",
14208,There had not been such a bombastically illustrated work in Sweden even 150 years after the invention of printing.,
14209,"Rudbeck also had rare access to all the pictured objects because they were in collections in Holland, Italy, or elsewhere.",
14210,"Using images, he thereby created and presented a kind of baroque cabinet of curiosities on paper to make his arguments.",
14211,This in and of itself would be an interesting research topic because Rudbeck’s objects were interpreted very differently than they would be today—and thus had a different meaning.,
14212,"Moreover, he didn’t work only with illustrations from collections but he also sent an expedition to northern Sweden to create mountain panoramas and collect geographical data from places that in his view had already been described by Plato and other ancient writers.",
14213,And this material is also still available to us.,
14214,It changed the original project proposal to the extent that it now doesn’t focus just on the illustrated objects such as antiquities and such but above all on the natural landscape itself.,
14215,"Rudbeck worked with this—the names of mountains, forests, or waterfalls, with their forms and with the myths behind them.",
14216,And these were crucial for him because nature from his viewpoint was unchangeable.,
14217,"In this, it contrasts with myths, which can change as they are passed on.",
14218,It is intriguing to go to Sweden today and to sensually experience the same key to mythology as if it were a thousand years ago.,
14219,"For Rudbeck, it was the final proof for his theory that it was only here that the sagas and myths could have taken place.",
14220,And this is where we now see the beginnings of the Anthropocene.,
14221,"We return to these landscapes again and realize: yes, they are still there but also somehow not—because we have irrevocably changed them.",
14222,Exactly.,
14223,"We don’t work only with historical objects; we also want, for example, to research and tell the stories behind their landscapes.",
14224,"Right now I am in Sweden in a mountain region that in the seventeenth century Rudbeck presented as the mountains that must have been the source of myths told by Ovid, such as the petrification of Atlas or the throne of the 9 muses—because the mountains have a certain form, because the mountains had certain natural features, because they have certain names.",
14225,"For example, the Helags glacier is connected to the Helicon, where according to classical mythology the above-mentioned muses originate.",
14226,"We study and make accessible to the broader public how Rudbeck and his colleagues developed their theory, with these very landscapes on their doorsteps.",
14227,"At the same time, however, part of the story is how they or we have changed these landscapes—through climate change, dams, deforestation in Swedish forestry—and that the myths no longer really match.",
14228,We get very quickly to an area that we call “environmental humanities.”,
14229,"It no longer focuses on the seventeenth century or mythology but on how we treat the landscape, how our stories connect us to landscapes, and how disconnected has this volume actually become?",
14230,We currently have no global story for the changes that we have wrought and in which we will have to live in the future.,
14231,The question is always: What is the subtext of these stories?,
14232,"Behind the phoenix myth, for example, Rudbeck sees the phenomenon of the sun disappearing behind the horizon at the polar circle in winter and then reappearing in spring.",
14233,"Other myths, on the other hand, are based for him on the midnight sun that does not go down in mid-summer.",
14234,"For him, a Greek could not have been the original creator or interpreter of the myths because the Greeks did not know these phenomena.",
14235,"The Greeks, in his telling, had only been “injected” with all of these mythologies by the first expeditions from Sweden to the Mediterranean.",
14236,"And thus, according to Rudbeck, the mythic tradition became decoupled from the natural world with which it had actually once been in contact.",
14237,"We think that in this work this is actually the most interesting point, because we in the twenty-first century also look at the world around us without any concrete connection to a forest, to a tree, to a mountain—for most of us, they don’t tell stories anymore.",
14238,"We feel less connected to the world around us and as a result, we treat it as something external, material.",
14239,The work by Rudbeck is our starting point for understanding the connection between landscapes and stories both historically and for the present.,
14240,And it give us a lot of ideas for concrete projects.,
14241,"Due to the pandemic, of course, it has been difficult.",
14242,Many of the events we planned had to be canceled.,
14243,"Another approach for us, however, is a children’s book with a different take on history.",
14244,"For example, there is the world’s oldest tree—a tree has revived from an ancient system of roots, which also goes hand in hand with climate change.",
14245,"This tree has seen the last ice age recede, the trees that came after, and the first humans; it saw the first expedition that Rudbeck sent off in 1675, and the first lumberjacks.",
14246,"It would be cool if we could turn this tree, which is 9,500 years old, into the protagonist of a children’s book.",
14247,"In general, this project focuses strongly on multimedia formats and diverse ways of understanding for different age groups and social backgrounds.",
14248,"In principle, we want to make everything—except the traditional book for the traditional academic.",
14249,"People should have the feeling that they want to know more; they want to change their view of the world.
",
14250,[ Miletus was one of the most important cities of classical antiquity.,
14251,"Research, headed by Prof. Dr. Christof Berns from the Archaeological Institute, is being conducted on the ruins, roughly 80 kilometers from Izmir.",
14252,Berns is interested in the use and appropriation of the city by diverse social groups.,
14253,One key to understanding this is the inscriptions from the imperial period (31 BCE– 312 CE).,
14254,And virtual reality also plays an important role.,
14255,"In fact, the ancients used any and everything to write on: walls, cobblestones, or the pedestals beneath statues, but also everyday objects.",
14256,Inscriptions were really a ubiquitous medium of public communication.,
14257,What is especially interesting is that they were used by very different people and in very different contexts.,
14258,"There are very official documents for the public honoring of a person or publications of the emperor’s letters, but also very brief naming documents to permanently mark seats in the theater and much more.",
14259,"We often find non-linguistic drawings, for example, sidewalks with squares scratched into them to mark a playing field.",
14260,"Overall, inscriptions reveal a very broad range of activity.",
14261,"If we look at their distribution throughout the urban space, then we can recognize, among other things, the political significance of a particular area due to the density of public documents being published.",
14262,We are investigating this in a project in our Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts.,
14263,We cannot say exactly.,
14264,But the variety of possible activities to which the inscriptions attest suggest that a large number of city residents could at least understand simple texts.,
14265,Even official inscriptions are not necessarily formulated in complicated ways.,
14266,Their structure is largely standardized and they always use the same vocabulary.,
14267,"Furthermore, they were often used to supplement other media.",
14268,A typical case is the so-called “honorary monument.”,
14269,You can imagine a statue portraying a person on a pedestal that bore an inscription.,
14270,"Thus, there was already a kind of memorial monument to honor a specific person.",
14271,It was sufficient to recognize the name to know for whom the distinction was intended.,
14272,"Only those who wanted to know more and, for example, find out what circumstances led to the honor needed to be able to read a bit more Greek.",
14273,"Virtual reality is the perfect instrument for our archaeological approach because space is central to the understanding of inscriptions—whereas earlier, inscriptions were understood and examined more as a specific genre.",
14274,But even just the inscribing of letters into stone makes them plastic objects and the written monument is also 3-dimensional.,
14275,"And finally, the placement of an inscription in the urban space impacts its message.",
14276,Standard tools such as maps and photos are insufficient for recording all of this.,
14277,"Using virtual reality, we can move throughout the entire structure and directly experience the effect of the inscriptions.",
14278,"In a first step, it was primarily the doctoral researchers Jenny Gabel (informatics) and Lauren Osthof (archaeology / ancient history) who developed a virtual reality model of the Miletus theater.",
14279,"With this aid, we can move through the entire structure and experience the effect of the many inscriptions directly and what relationship they had to one another.",
14280,"We can also populate the virtual reality model with avatars, or abstract images of people, to determine how the activities in relation to the inscriptions shaped public space.",
14281,"Lauren Osthof arduously documented all fixed inscriptions in Miletus, including numerous game squares mentioned above and that had previously attracted little attention.",
14282,A fascinating result of this work is the discovery that leisure in imperial Miletus was a very present phenomenon.,
14283,"You can specially find such squares on the margins of public squares, on the steps of public monuments, or in the entryways of buildings.",
14284,Virtual reality makes very visible how much we need to see urban space in some areas as highly dominated by people who spent time sitting and playing.,
14285,"Natrually, this creates a different view of the ancient city; one that is not just seen as unused architecture.",
14286,The excavation is very significant in Turkey.,
14287,"This has to do with the fact that Miletus, which reaches back to the end of the fourth century BCE and extends to the fifteenth century CE, is a significant historical location.",
14288,"Furthermore, the excavation itself is full of tradition, because Berlin museums already initiated it in 1899.",
14289,I am therefore even more grateful to the Turkish Directorate-General for Antiquities and Museums for trusting me with overseeing the excavation.,
14290,We are working closely with colleagues and students from Istanbul’s Mimar Sinan University and also with the local museum.,
14291,"In the last few years, the excavation has also grown into more of an international project.",
14292,"Most recently, we were able to offer a summer school program for Turkish students, thanks to support from DAAD.",
14293,"It is especially nice that such cooperation often leads to further connections, for example, student or researchers exchanges.
",
14294,"For some, it’s the best part of the school day, for others, torture.",
14295,"Ah, gym class!",
14296,Yet what makes for good school sports?,
14297,This is the question at the heart of the QualiTePE project with Prof. Dr. Erin Gerlach and Dr. Wiebke Langer at the Institute of Human Movement Science.,
14298,Our series Doing the Research introduces research projects at Universität Hamburg.,
14299,"Erin Gerlach: In almost all of the curricula throughout Germany, there is consensus about the programmatic goal of gym class, the so-called “double mission.”",
14300,"On the one hand, teaching sports—children should get to learn about sports and movement and how to do them.",
14301,"On the other hand, there is a mission to teach through sports, that is to promote development through movement, games, and sports.",
14302,This also involves critically reflecting upon sports.,
14303,"Religion lessons are not, of course, about memorizing quotes from the Bible but about addressing the larger themes.",
14304,It’s about learning to behave in and through sports.,
14305,Good sports lessons foster that.,
14306,"Wiebke Langer: For this, sports lessons need to cover various pedagogical perspectives that go beyond pure achievement, for example, social aspects such as teamwork, body perception or encouragement to take risks, special kinds of experiences with movement or expressing yourself physically.",
14307,"On the whole, good sports lessons are not about playing sports but about how sports are staged and embedded.",
14308,"For example, classic types of sports can be completely reinterpreted.",
14309,Gerlach:,
14310,The curricula do not mention specific types of sports but so-called “areas of movement.”,
14311,"For example, one is called “movement on and with equipment.”",
14312,"Naturally, this involves classic gymnastics equipment, but these things change—just like sports culture outside of school.",
14313,So these areas can be developed and involve students.,
14314,"Take parkour, for example, which originated in France.",
14315,It is basically mastering the urban environment.,
14316,You have to overcome creative hurdles.,
14317,This is also a type of movement using equipment that is often much more appealing to students than classic gymnastics.,
14318,Langer:,
14319,And we have the advantage of closely linking research and teaching.,
14320,We work with our students using teaching formats in which they can develop ideas for practical phases at schools and then directly implement them.,
14321,We notice that for upcoming teachers another understanding of gym class has already become established.,
14322,Gerlach: Empirical classroom research distinguishes 3 features of good classroom instruction: class management and lesson planning; a pupil-oriented learning environment; and the potential for cognitive activation.,
14323,"Then there are things such as the selection of specific material and methods and formative assessments, meaning the ongoing review of learning processes and appropriate feedback.",
14324,"As a first step, we spoke with our colleagues at other European universities about what these dimensions mean for sports lessons in their own countries.",
14325,"For example, in sports lessons class management involves managing material and space, that is, handling “organized chaos”—after all, everyone is constantly moving.",
14326,"When it comes to the learning environment, it’s about building trustworthy working relationships.",
14327,"Activation means being physically active and linking this activity to thinking, that is, acquiring strategies and knowledge about physical processes when moving or playing sports—within the context of school sports, this means movement-related and cognition-related activation.",
14328,It’s about everyone who works for good sports lessons at every level.,
14329,Langer:,
14330,"On the basis of the developed and structured dimensions and features of lesson-plan quality, we will conduct a so-called “Delphi Survey” of the international players within and outside the universities, i.e., academics with research expertise in the professionalization of gym teachers and/or lesson-plan quality for gym classes; university teachers; and people involved in the practical training of gym teachers, for example, seminar instructors.",
14331,"Then there are the people charged with country-specific quality development for gym classes, for example, school inspectors.",
14332,It’s about everyone who works for good sports lessons at every level.,
14333,"In this multi-staged survey, we want to found out how they evaluate the individual criteria.",
14334,"Ultimately, we should have a tool for talking about and assessing the quality of gym classes.",
14335,Gerlach:,
14336,"We want to incorporate 3 perspectives into the tool: the teachers’, an observer’s, and the school students’— because the perception, for example of the learning environment, can vary dramatically.",
14337,"And this would then be a starting point for seeing why, for example, a teacher perceives it completely differently from his students.",
14338,"The tool can then be used for training purposes as well as by practitioners, as a starting point for reflecting upon one’s own actions for the purpose of professional development.",
14339,"Gerlach: Of course, we are seeking compromise where country-specific conditions and concepts cannot be taken into account.",
14340,"But on the whole, we can already see that an understanding of quality related to sports lessons can be depicted and investigated beyond borders.",
14341,Langer:,
14342,This intercultural exchange is also very enriching.,
14343,"You learn a lot about the understanding of movement and sports, in themselves and as a school subject, as well as about how lessons are designed in other countries.",
14344,It’s eye-opening.,
14345,I studied in Germany and gained my experiences at school here.,
14346,"It’s just interesting to now get to know and discuss other perspectives.
",
14347,Gender stereotypes can strongly influence teachers’ expectations.,
14348,"In the TEG-Know project, researchers from the Faculty of Education, in cooperation with the Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Kiel and Freie Universität Berlin, are looking into whether professional knowledge has a positive impact.",
14349,Prof. Dr. Jan Retelsdorf talks about the challenges in research on stereotypes in schools in our Doing the Research series.,
14350,We all stereotype.,
14351,"Thus, in my opinion, everyone who needs to judge others in their professional life needs to learn to question their professional actions.",
14352,Teachers also have their stereotypes that they can’t just shake off.,
14353,But these should not be relevant in their professional activities.,
14354,Teachers need to ask themselves: How do I judge?,
14355,Is it fair to the individual?,
14356,"Basically, there are 2 possibilities for identifying stereotyping, although it must also be said that neither is perfect.",
14357,"With implicit methods, we often measure reaction times: for example, the test subjects need to assign terms like “adding and subtracting,” “mathematics,” or “reading” to other terms such as “girls” or “boys” and we measure how quickly that happens.",
14358,"Basically, we are just measuring associations without knowing exactly whether they are stereotypical.",
14359,"With explicit methods, we provide statements, such as yours, to the test subjects and they have to respond.",
14360,"The danger here is mainly that subjects will give socially acceptable answers, but sometimes even we are surprised at which stereotypes are agreed with.",
14361,"We assume that stereotypes affect teachers’ expectations, among other things, of individual children.",
14362,"Previous studies have shown that positive expectations of a child generally positively impact performance while negative expectations, accordingly, have the opposite effect.",
14363,"For example: Because Lisa is a girl, the teacher may presume that she can’t count as well and, accordingly, develops lower academic expectations for her.",
14364,"These expectations can, in turn affect behavior, consciously or subconsciously.",
14365,"This can mean, for example, that Lisa is called on less or she gets easier math problems.",
14366,"This reduces Lisa’s motivation because she notices that the teacher doesn’t trust her, and that can lead to worse performance.",
14367,"Professional knowledge in this project means, above all, expertise in teaching and psychology.",
14368,No one is free of stereotypical thinking.,
14369,But we can assume that this kind of knowledge means that teachers are aware of the possible consequences of stereotyping and try to correct their expectations or to not allow them to impact their behavior.,
14370,We worked together with 50 second-grade classrooms in Hamburg and northern Germany.,
14371,"At the beginning of the school year, we explicitly asked math teachers how they assess boys and girls with regard to their math skills.",
14372,"Initially, we were more interested in potential, not concrete achievements.",
14373,We also checked the teachers’ knowledge of their own professions using a standardized test.,
14374,"At the beginning, middle, and end of the school year, we also tested the pupils’ achievements and asked them about their own motivation in math.",
14375,"We correlated these data with the teacher data and looked at how gender-specific expectations on the part of the teachers, in connection with their knowledge of the profession, actually impact their pupils’ achievements.",
14376,We are dealing with relatively significant automatic behaviors.,
14377,"So far, we haven’t been able to find a connection to professional knowledge.",
14378,That means that greater knowledge of the profession does not reduce the connection between stereotyping and expectations and student achievement.,
14379,"It was to some extent to be expected, because we are dealing with relatively significant automatic behaviors and ways of processing information.",
14380,We know from the basic research in social psychology that it is not easy to dismantle stereotypes.,
14381,"Thus, we pursued the study with an open mind to see if professional knowledge might, on the contrary, make an impact.",
14382,This was a first attempt at taking a look in this direction.,
14383,"Basically, the test we used and also our study generally focus on pedagogical psychology, because there are no tried-and-true tests in the areas of judgment distortion and evaluation.",
14384,"Here, we can made any necessary adjustments and look at how specific knowledge impacts these areas.
",
14385,[ The EU has once again reformed its emissions trading system—even though the previous reform had yet to go into effect.,
14386,"Grischa Perino, professor of economics at Universität Hamburg, has taken a closer look at the planned changes for the journal Nature Climate Change.",
14387,His conclusions: The changes will not permanently fix the flaws in the system and may even undermine other climate protection policies.,
14388,They are also so complicated that it is nearly impossible to take stock of the consequences.,
14389,They system had always been conceived in phases so that it could be adjusted every 8 to 10 years.,
14390,So reforms are nothing unusual.,
14391,"This time, however, there are fundamental changes because the prices for certificates, meaning the right to emit greenhouse gases, have roundly failed to meet expectations.",
14392,They only cost about €5–10 rather than the expected €30–40.,
14393,"Such low prices do not motivate companies, however, to invest in climate-friendly technologies, which is essential if the EU is to reach its climate goals.",
14394,"To drive investment, you need to raise prices.",
14395,That’s why the EU already decided in 2015 to introduce a complicated mechanism known as the market stability reserve.,
14396,"The idea is that the number of certificates on the market in a given year reflect real demand—in the past, the number was set long before by policy-makers.",
14397,"Starting in 2019, the market stability reserve will soak up the certificates if so many are on the market that companies hoard them.",
14398,Then emissions rights will become scarce and their prices will rise.,
14399,The problem is that the certificates kept off the market will be disbursed again once the companies have used up their reserves and prices will go down again.,
14400,So the mechanism only works for a short time.,
14401,"Initially, the idea was to make the withheld certificates available again at a later point.",
14402,"This, of course, would have done little for climate protection.",
14403,That’s why the EU has now made it possible for the first time to get rid of the certificates.,
14404,"Starting in 2023, they will look to see how many certificates are in the market stability reserve and how many have companies bought.",
14405,"If there are more certificates in the reserve than the companies have bought, the surplus will be “deleted.”",
14406,"In theory, yes, but I have reservations about the implementation.",
14407,"Because it has been possible to save emissions rights since 2008, the mechanism is retroactive.",
14408,"If the rules are also retroactive, governments and companies cannot plan reliably.",
14409,"Yet it is especially important for climate protection to ensure that the various tools such as emissions trading or, for example, the energy revolution and fossil fuel phase-out are coordinated long-term.",
14410,The system has become unbelievably complicated.,
14411,I doubt that those involved can figure out how the market stability reserve is going to impact prices and total emissions.,
14412,"Furthermore, the effects change from year to year because of changing rules and they only become clear in hindsight—as in this case.",
14413,"But how can we make meaningful decisions, how can we weigh whether or not it’s worth investing in climate-friendly technology?",
14414,"To raise the certificate prices, simple measures would suffice, for example, introducing a price minimum.",
14415,"As a next step, you could create a direct link between the price and the number of certificates.",
14416,Or create a central bank for emissions rights.,
14417,"There is no dearth of ideas to improve emissions trading, which is actually a simple and powerful instrument.",
14418,"Now, however, regulations are being passed that are ludicrously complicated and yet generally ineffective.

14419,[ Supporting outstanding young scientists with innovative projects in basic research - that is the goal of the so-called Starting Grants of the European Research Council.,
14420,Since 1 September physicist Dr. Guillaume Salomon has been using such an ERC grant to investigate fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that are of particular interest for future quantum technologies.,
14421,"Quantum technologies are extremely versatile: Quantum sensors can warn of earthquakes, quantum cryptography can protect our privacy in the long term, and quantum computers with their huge amounts of data will revolutionize the computer world.",
14422,One of the central milestones on the way to the realization of quantum computers is the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computations.,
14423,"With his acquired funding, Dr. Guillaume Salomon wants to develop a novel platform for quantum simulation and quantum computation.",
14424,The planned platform uses ultracold atoms that can be transformed into highly excited Rydberg states by laser pulses.,
14425,Rydberg atoms are particularly sensitive to electric and magnetic fields due to their large size and large number of closely spaced energy levels.,
14426,"In the Rydberg state, the atoms couple strongly with each other, whereas in the ground state they are excellently isolated from the environment and can be stored.",
14427,The planned apparatus will be used to construct and study topological phases of matter that are of interest for fault-tolerant quantum computation.,
14428,"Dr. Guillaume Solomons work, which is supported by the European Research Council (ERC) with €1.5 million, perfectly complements the goals of Research Area A of the Cluster of Excellence “CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter” for the design of novel quantum functionalities.",
14429,"In addition, there are direct opportunities for cooperation with solid-state physics and theoretical physics.",
14430,", The scientist has been at the Institute of Laser Physics at Universität Hamburg since 1 August 2020 and is one of the first so-called Young Investigator Group Leaders in the Cluster of Excellence.",
14431,These positions were newly introduced as part of the Clusters promotion of young researchers.,
14432,The target group are highly talented young scientists with the ability to independently conduct their own challenging research projects and to obtain or have already obtained their own funding at the level of Emmy Noether Groups or ERC Starting Grants.,
14433,", The scientists are individually supported by the cluster with a development program on their scientific career and are assigned to a so-called host.",
14434,It is fantastic that the University of Hamburg and the Cluster of Excellence have been able to attract such an excellent young researcher.,
14435,"This will strengthen research in the field of quantum technologies in the long term, and I am very much looking forward to working with Guillaume,” says Prof. Dr. Henning Moritz from the Institute of Laser Physics, who will take on the role of host.

14442,"Since 2021, Universität Hamburg has been a member of the European University Alliance for Global Health, or “EUGLOH” for short.",
14443,"Viktoria Kurnosenko, EUGLOH team head and project coordinator at Universität Hamburg, talks in the interview below about how teachers and researchers can get involved and how students benefit.",
14444,EUGLOH is one of 44 European university alliances being funded within the scope of the European Universities Initiative.,
14445,"Nine universities from various European regions are members of EUGLOH and together, they are developing a common European campus with co-created teaching programs and research activities focusing on global health.",
14446,Global health is understood in this context broadly and with an interdisciplinary approach.,
14447,"It covers not only traditional topics in medicine but also, for example, health economics, climate research, legal matters, ethics, etc.",
14448,"One important goal of EUGLOH, and also its greatest challenge, is to create a strong and well-connected alliance with a common structure and processes.",
14449,"These will be established long-term at the participating universities and give practical opportunities to their respective students, researchers, teachers, and staff.",
14450,"By including all groups, EUGLOH will be valuable to everyone involved.",
14451,"New, innovative formats can be tried and internal internationalization processes can be reflected upon and further developed.",
14452,"International exchange in EUGLOH primarily takes place online, although there are also joint events and partner meetings.",
14453,There are 8 “work packages” on overarching topics such as transnational teaching and learning; research-based learning; student employability; or campus life.,
14454,"Within Universität Hamburg, there is especially close exchange between the Department of International Affairs—where the EUGLOH project team is based—and the Knowledge Exchange Agency.",
14455,The Knowledge Exchange Agency coordinates knowledge exchange activities for EUGLOH within the scope of the service-to-society work package.,
14456,There is close cooperation with the UKE in the area of research cooperation.,
14457,"EUGLOH focuses on many questions that directly impact students, for example, the development of a digital European Student Card, the creation of new interdisciplinary courses, and improving student mobility.",
14458,"To this end, our motto is “Nothing about us without us”—the EUGLOH student board is an opportunity for students at Universität Hamburg to contribute their ideas and feedback directly and to exchange with other EUGLOH students.",
14459,"Generally, all students at Universität Hamburg benefit from EUGLOH: they can attend courses, seminars, and training opportunities offered in English both in person and online.",
14460,"There are also opportunities for short stays at EUGLOH universities, summer school programs, and, in the future, Erasmus semesters.",
14461,Innovative teaching is crucial to EUGLOH.Teachers who wish to develop co-creative and innovative teaching programs with other EUGLOH researchers and who are interested in exchange on topics such as joint degrees or the European Degree or other co-creative formats are welcome to contact the EUGLOH project team.,
14462,We offer researchers networking opportunities through matchmaking workshops funded via the accompanying DAAD Research in EUGLOH project.,
14463,Funding for research stays of up to one month at EUGLOH universities is available for doctoral and early career researchers.,
14464,All Universität Hamburg employees can take part in international programs.,
14465,These range from staff weeks and topic-related training opportunities to a variety of other professional training opportunities offered at all 8 EUGLOH universities.,
14466,You can also pursue contacts with international colleagues in the alliance who are working in an area similar to yours.,
14467,"The EUGLOH team is happy to help you initiate contact and can set up contact to extant working groups in which other University staff members are already involved and who can help you tap the network to advance your own work at the University.

14468,Universität Hamburg enjoys another resounding success with the German Research Foundation (DFG) DFG has approved and will fund all 4 research training groups (RTGs) to the tune of €19.3 million in total.,
14469,"The research training groups will begin their work in April 2020 in the Departments of Economics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics.",
14470,"The interdisciplinary research program of the Research Training Group “Collective Decisions” focuses on various decision-making processes such as voting and deliberation (seeking consensus), political competition, and questions of responsibility for collective decision-making.",
14471,"Against the current backdrop of challenges or even threats to democratic structures and established alliances in many countries (see, for example, Brexit), this issues could not be more pressing.",
14472,"Research incorporates theories and methods from 3 main areas: political science, economics, and philosophy.",
14473,"Prof. Dr. Anke Gerber from the Department of Economics in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences is the RTG’s spokesperson.",
14474,"In the Research Training Group “Biota-Mediate Effects on Carbon Cycling in Estuaries” (BiCEst), researchers will investigate the impact of various organisms such as plants, animals, and micro-organisms on the carbon cycle of estuaries.",
14475,Estuaries are the wider parts of a river that then flows into the open sea.,
14476,They form an important part of the marine and global carbon cycle.,
14477,"However, they also number among the most threatened systems.",
14478,"The reasons are global warming and the attendant rise in sea-levels, increased nutrient pollution, and changes in land and water use.",
14479,Researchers will analyze the Elbe estuary to determine the significance of organisms and their interactions in the carbon cycle.,
14480,The goal is to document the effects of global climate change on the carbon cycle.,
14481,Greater understanding of these processes should help us to better illustrate the effects of organisms on the carbon cycle in Earth system models.,
14482,"Prof. Dr. Kai Jensen is the spokesperson for the BiCEst Research Training Group, which is coordinated in the Department of Biology.",
14483,Research Training Group “Hybrid Structures on the Nanoscale: Chemical Concepts to Prepare Heterogeneous Nanostructures with Anisotropic Material Properties” (NANOHYBRID) is coordinated in the Department of Chemistry.,
14484,"Researchers want to create nanoscopic hybrid systems with special material properties, meaning materials made of building blocks the size of a millionth of a millimeter.",
14485,"For the past several years, these materials have been intensively researched but it was only in recent years that, in addition to the size of the nanostructures their form has become significant with regard to their properties.",
14486,"In NANOHYBRID, researchers want to develop innovative chemical concepts to create, link, and analyze these kinds of nanostructures.",
14487,Prof. Dr. Alf Mews from the Department of Chemistry is the RTG’s spokesperson.,
14488,"The Research Training Group “Modeling, Simulation and Optimization of Fluid Dynamic Applications” run jointly with the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) aims to provide early career researchers with holistic and application-oriented training in the mathematical disciplines of modeling, simulation, and optimization.",
14489,Training and research will take place in line with the principle “mathematics drives applications—applications inspire mathematics.”,
14490,"The researchers will address relevant issues in climate research, meteorology, aerospace-and nautical engineering, and medicine.",
14491,The RTG will be integrated into the Lothar Collatz Center for Computing in Science.,
14492,Prof Dr. Armin Iske from the Department of Mathematics at Universität Hamburg is the spokesperson;,
14493,Prof. Dr.-Ing.,
14494,Thomas Rung from the Institute of Fluid Dynamics and Ship Theory at the Hamburg University of Technology is his deputy.,
14495,"Katharina Fegebank, senator for science, research and equalities, said: “The approval of all 4 grant applications for DFG RTG funding is a terrific achievement for Universität Hamburg and the Hamburg University of Technology and I warmly congratulate you!”",
14496,"Following success in the Excellence Strategy, Hamburg as a center of scientific endeavor has once again been provide to be a place where young researches can expect optimal conditions.",
14497,"These include ambitious, multi-disciplinary research programs and a stimulating environment in which they can familiarize themselves with state-of-the-art equipment and methods.",
14498,"The approved RTGs will contribute further to defining Hamburg’s research profile and international visibility by fortifying the core research areas Climate, Earth, Environment and Photon and Nanosciences.",
14499,"The fourth RTG, Collective Decisions, is especially politically relevant and strengthens the area of potential Grounds, Causes,Reasons.",
14500,Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.,
14501,"Dieter Lenzen, president of Universität Hamburg, said: “The extraordinary success of the researchers at the University of Excellence Universität Hamburg deserves our highest admiration.",
14502,I thank everyone who made this further achievement at the University in its 100th anniversary year possible.,
14503,"The outstanding result shows that purposeful strategic university planning and things like equanimity and the absence of undue pressure are the cornerstones of excellent university development.”
",
14504,The European Union’s FET Open program funds research projects on promising technologies.,
14505,"In the last round, 2 projects that included teams from Universität Hamburg were also successful.",
14506,"Two projects in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Earth System Sciences in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences will receive a total of roughly €1 million.",
14507,The projects begin in 2021 and will last 4 years.,
14508,Many industrial processes produce superfluous heat—waste heat that is often lost.,
14509,"While there are technologies to convert heat into electricity, they are costly and inefficient, for example, at temperatures below 100 degrees Celsius.",
14510,"In the EHAWEDRY project, researchers want to change this and develop a new technology for converting waste heat into electricity.",
14511,"“Our ideas are making completely new inroads into saving energy and producing electricity,” says Prof. Dr. Michael Fröba from the Department of Chemistry at Universität Hamburg and one of the EHAWEDRY project partners.",
14512,Researchers in the project will use supercapacitors that are normally used for fast electricity storage.,
14513,"In line with their innovative research concept, researchers will focus on contact surfaces between electrodes and a salty electrolyte solution.",
14514,"The electrodes in the capacitors will be dried using waste heat and then sprayed again so that, ultimately, thermal energy is converted into electricity.",
14515,The EHAWEDRY project will develop and use nanoporous electrodes.,
14516,These high surface materials are advantageous because they can efficiently convert lower-temperature waste heat into electricity.,
14517,"This innovative technology is thus much more beneficial with regard to cost, scalability, and flexibility in various applications.",
14518,The EHAWEDRY project aims to create a prototype.,
14519,"Eight institutions are taking part in the project, which has been granted a total of €2,997,615.",
14520,"Prof. Fröba’s research group will receive €399,865 and will oversee, among other things, the production of the nanoporous electrodes as well as the structural and chemical characterization of the materials.",
14521,"To limit climate warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, not only do we need to produce fewer greenhouse gases; we also need to retrieve them from the atmosphere and safely store them.",
14522,"So far, there has been no sustainable, energy-efficient, and cheap negative emission technology for a large area.",
14523,A natural process for retrieving CO2 from the atmosphere is the weathering of rock.,
14524,"When this happens, CO2—regardless of the volume of basic ions—is bound in water in alkaline form and transported by river to the ocean.",
14525,"There, the alkaline counters the ocean’s acidity and stays for thousands of years.",
14526,"In the BAM project, which will receive funding of just about €3.5 million, reactor-based procedures will be developed to accelerate weathering with the help of biological processes and to purposefully steer machine-learning algorithms.",
14527,"Prof. Dr. Jens Hartmann from CEN will receive €640,625 for his part of the project and will collaborate with an international team to look at how to accelerate the decomposition of rock flour with living organisms and retrieved CO2.",
14528,The by-products of this procedure should counteract ocean acidity and improve depleted soils to achieve further sustainability goals.,
14529,"“Our goal is to develop an instrument that—in the short-term, meaning within 10 to 20 years—can make a maximum contribution to climate neutrality with a minimal use of resources.”

14531,"The University’s president, Prof. Dr. Hauke Heekeren, and the chair of DESY’s board of directors, Prof. Dr. Helmut Dosch, greeted the group.",
14532,Hamburg’s science senator Katharina Fegebank and the Hamburg Parliament member Sven Tode also took part.,
14533,"At the Centre for Structural Systems Biology (CSSB), an interdisciplinary center with partners from various universities and research institutions, Kai Gehring, Laura Kraft, and Peter Heidt were able to gain an overview of the development of the location and the research conducted there.",
14534,"“Four of our five core research areas are anchored here in Bahrenfeld,” explained Prof. Dr. Heekeren, pointing out the importance of the upcoming research location for Universität Hamburg.",
14535,"With the planned move to the site by the Departments of Chemistry and Biology, the district will also see a more mixed population, including a higher number of students.",
14536,"In the afternoon, politicians will see PETRA III, one of the world’s brightest collider-based X-Ray sources, run by DESY.",
14537,"Gehring remarked that in the past, he knew Hamburg mainly as a port city.",
14538,"“In the meantime, however, Hamburg has long become one of the republic’s most important research hubs.",
14539,"Here, excellent infrastructure is used by outstanding researchers to solve important questions of the future.",
14540,"We want to continue to support the development of this site, at both state and federal levels, as well as possible,” said Gehring at the end of the visit.",
14541,"The committee for education, research, and technological impact advises the Bundestag on long-term policy decisions in research and education, for example, on the funding of research sites or technology policy matters.

14549,Background:,
14550,"The time line room with a floor map of University buildings The new exhibition on Universität Hamburg’s past and present gives an exciting glimpse into 100 years of teaching, research, campus life, and university culture.",
14551,It also reveals a University that reflects Germany’s own eventful history.,
14552,Universität Hamburg has been an integral part of the city for 100 years.,
14553,"As a University of Excellence, it counts among Germany’s top research and teaching institutions.",
14554,The recently opened exhibition covers 300 square meters in the historical Main Building and traces the University’s evolution.,
14555,It looks closely at the struggle to establish the University and shows how it became a magnet in the 1920s for Germany’s top scientific minds.,
14556,"It also looks at the National Socialist era, in which many of these great researchers and scholars were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis.",
14557,"A citadel of science, a locus of student revolt The exhibition further traces the arduous task of reestablishing University teaching after the War and highlights legendary student protests.",
14558,"It continues to focus on the University’s rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s, showing how the University became one of Germany’s largest, with a sophisticated teaching apparatus and outstanding research.",
14559,"In 2018, the University was granted funding for 4 clusters of excellence, the largest interdisciplinary research projects to receive funding from the German Research Foundation.",
14560,"In July 2019, Universität Hamburg was also named a University of Excellence in a national competition for funding for top university research.",
14561,"The exhibition takes a two-pronged approach to illuminating the University’s past and present: First, it provides an informative time line.",
14562,"This includes previously unpublished historical photographs of everyday University life, including lectures from different decades, researchers at work, buildings under construction, and students from various epochs.",
14563,The time line also integrates audio stations with the voices of contemporary witnesses.,
14564,"You can hear, for example, Helga Bauer, the head of the student council in 1967, or ISS commander Alexander Gerst, a University alumnus.",
14565,"Generator of world knowledge and significant cultural institution Secondly, the exhibition focuses on particular topics, with special displays to illuminate the various facets of university life.",
14566,"“World Knowledge,” for example, includes seeds collected from all over the world to highlight the University’s long tradition as a research institution with a global reach; a Chinese traveling library; and audio recordings of African languages made in the 1930s.",
14567,“Theater” illuminates the history of the University as a hotbed of cultural activity.,
14568,"It includes historical plays, production posters, playbills, and records.",
14569,“Research Fields” shines a light on scientific and scholarly achievement at the University using videos and photographs of historical and current experiments and research activities as well as scientific instruments from various decades.,
14570,Hands-on artwork There are also works of art that reflect upon the University’s history.,
14571,A particular highlight is the media installation Perpetual Metamorphosis by the New York artist Ruth Sergel.,
14572,"The visitor encounters people, sounds, and voices from the University’s past and present, combined on different screens in a Monty Python-esque collage.",
14573,The pillars that greet the visitor in the courtyard in front of the Main Building were created by the German artist Frank Fietzek.,
14574,They also fuse impressions from 100 years of University history.,
14575,"If you turn the handle, you activate 2 megaphones from which you can hear voices and quotes from over the decades.",
14576,"This mix makes it clear that, since its founding, the University has been both an inspiration to the city and a reflection of German history.
",
14577,"In the next few years, Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld will provide a leading international hub for natural sciences research.",
14578,A group from the European parliament met on 17 February to find out about the current scientific activities and plans for the future.,
14579,The members of the Panel for the Future of Science and Technology (STOA) is a panel of the European parliament devoted to all issues related to science and technology.,
14580,They visited the scientists and researchers based at Universität Hamburg and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY).,
14581,"The STOA chairperson, Dr. Christian Ehler, and vice-chairperson Ivo Hristov captured a snapshot of the research institution of the future.",
14582,"They were accompanied by Luisa Antunes, policy analyst in the STOA Scientific Foresight Unit.",
14583,"Prof. Dr. Arwen Pearson and Prof. Dr Klaus Sengstock from the Faculty of Physics at Universität Hamburg greeted the deputation in the highly-modern research building of Hamburg Advanced Research Centre for Bioorganic Chemistry, or HARBOR for short.",
14584,Here they demonstrated the work of the Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter and provided detailed descriptions of the collaboration with other institutions in the Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld.,
14585,"In addition, the group were given an insight into the outstanding Haus der Lehre—Light & Schools where they were welcomed by Prof. Dr. Hauke Heekeren and state secretary Dr. Eva Gümbel.",
14586,Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld is one of the largest government urban development projects ever undertaken in Hamburg.,
14587,"In the next two decades, a new suburb in which living, research, work, and recreation will come together over 125 hectares.",
14588,"In the future, it is anticipated that 4,000 researchers and 3,000 students from all over the world will be active here.
",
14589,Researching in Australia: Educational Scientist Dr. phil.,
14590,des.,
14591,Anja Augsdörfer has begun the first joint-postdoctoral research position with Universität Hamburg and Macquarie University in Sydney: She is researching the methods teachers currently use to help students develop what is known as computational thinking.,
14592,"Here, a first report.",
14593,"Universität Hamburg, Macquarie University and Fudan University in Shanghai have already been working in collaboration for many years.",
14594,I did my doctoral dissertation at Universität Hamburg and spent four weeks doing research at Macquarie University.,
14595,The Department of International Affairs helped me an incredible amount with that.,
14596,"My supervisor, Prof. Siemon had already had contact with Prof. Bower in Sydney.",
14597,"During my stay there, it came out that our fields of research overlapped in some places, and we came up with the idea that I could come back to do a joint-postdoc.",
14598,"Prof. Bower, who I am working for here, is conducting intensive research into computational thinking.",
14599,"This is a hotly discussed topic, that presumes that school children are faced with complex challenges in this age of globalization and technical advancement.",
14600,These challenges require the mastering of new skills.,
14601,"This skills should enable school students to break complex problems down into parts, pattern recognition, abstraction and the development of algorithms to solve those problems.",
14602,In short: to develop solutions and formulate them in a way that a computer can execute.,
14603,"As part of the project, and with the support of companies and local government, we are offering workshops for teachers in the greater Sydney area.",
14604,Australia has just introduced a new curriculum called “Digital Technologies and Computational Thinking.”,
14605,"For many teachers, this is completely new territory, and difficult to implement in the classroom.",
14606,"Alongside research into which didactic theories and methods are the most effective, we are trying to offer innovative professional development opportunities to teachers.",
14607,I did my doctorate as part of the “ProfaLe” project in the field of teacher education.,
14608,"Specifically, I focused on the use of video-based reflection and measuring competency.",
14609,The results of our work so far are providing a very good basis for future development.,
14610,"Ideally, at the end of my time in Australia, we will have held two rounds of workshops, and carried out the research that goes with that.",
14611,"In Hamburg, at the Institute of Vocational and Business Education we focus on media technology, that is, professional teacher education with a focus on educators in the media field.",
14612,We will bring the results from the workshops and concepts on “Computational Thinking and Digital Technologies” into teacher education at both the bachelor and master level.,
14613,There are a few differences.,
14614,"In particular, you notice that teacher education is quite nation specific, even though the world is becoming increasingly globalized.",
14615,"Particularly in the field of teacher education, you really have to first see how it works in that specific country.",
14616,How do you get in touch with the schools?,
14617,What permissions do you need before you can collect data?,
14618,What cultural differences are there in regard to teacher learning and hierarchies in the schools and universities?,
14619,"On top of all that, the higher education system is organized differently.",
14620,"Universities fund themselves from student fees, which makes working here more competitive.",
14621,"But all in all it is a very pleasant, open and collegial working environment.",
14622,The proximity to Asia is something I also find very tempting.,
14623,I have lived in Hamburg for 15 years and I love the city.,
14624,"At the moment, of course I miss my friends and colleagues, and sometimes German cuisine, I miss having well-organized public transport and the proximity to the cultural diversity of Europe.",
14625,But there is a reason why I have been to Australia 6 times: Sydney is a global metropolis with beaches on the Pacific Ocean and the Australian outdoor lifestyle give me a wonderful quality of life here.,
14626,"And yet: I actually planned to have an “endless summer”, but I seem to have landed in an endless winter.",
14627,"In a city without central heating, when it is 5 degrees outside, your apartment can sometimes get uncomfortably chilly.",
14628,My timing was a little off on that—particularly given that the weather in Hamburg is great at the moment.,
14629,"But as long as the sun is shining here, and it usually does, everything is wonderful.
",
14630,Prof. Dr. Ulf Schmidt will become the first nucleus professor at Universität Hamburg at the beginning of September.,
14631,"With its calls for applications for these professorships, the University aims to attract leading researchers and to advance the development of research areas, such as Infection Research.",
14632,The application calls for nucleus professorships (nucleus is Latin for “kernel”) are being advertised within the scope of the Excellence Initiative of the Federal and State Governments.,
14633,The history of medical ethics is at the center of my work.,
14634,"Until now, this subject area has been dealt with by philosophers or physicians; it is new for a historian to tackle it.",
14635,I look at the topic in the context of its respective era and social background.,
14636,"In the context of the project “Taming the European Leviathan: The Legacy of Post-War Medicine and the Common Good,” funded by the ERC Synergy Grant, I will also deal with this topic intensively over the next 6 years.",
14637,Two colleagues and I acquired this grant in order to investigate the importance of health in various European countries in the postwar period.,
14638,This question seemingly makes it possible to identify common European values and to answer the question of what actually holds Europe together—across the system boundaries between the former Eastern bloc and the capitalist-oriented countries of the West.,
14639,"However, I would like to emphasize that I personally do not find my research interests that diverse.",
14640,"For me, the topics merge into one another, and one often results from the other.",
14641,I am fascinated by the tension between German and Anglo-American historiography.,
14642,"In Germany, researchers focus strongly on source criticism.",
14643,"By contrast, in the United Kingdom and the United States, they often take a more essayistic, even narrative, approach and focus on people’s everyday experiences.",
14644,"In my work, I always try to bring these traditions together.",
14645,I believe that a certain distance can be an advantage for a historian.,
14646,"On the one hand, there is the temporal distance—even in modern history, you need an interval of at least around 30 years in my opinion.",
14647,"This, by the way, means that historical research into East Germany, with all its contradictions, makes an increasing multiperspectivity possible.",
14648,But spatial distance can also be helpful.,
14649,"You are not part of the system to the same degree and, for example, do not have to consider political factors to a great extent or national sentiment and related taboos when particularly sensitive issues are touched upon, as was often the case in my research.",
14650,"So I am sure that the change in my place of residence will lead to a change in perspective, but without being able to predict exactly how this will manifest itself.",
14651,It is exciting that the nucleus professorship will enable me to once again build an interdisciplinary research center and thus establish a basis for different people and disciplines to cooperate.,
14652,"In Kent, I headed the Centre for the History of Medicine, Ethics and Medical Humanities.",
14653,"At Universität Hamburg, I would like to initiate something similar.",
14654,I am also impressed with what the University has achieved in the Excellence Initiative and am looking forward to participating in it from the fall.,
14655,"My future colleagues gave me an extremely warm welcome during our initial talks, and I am also very much looking forward to working with them.

14659,"Together, they have already presented existent measures and goals, identified new fields of action, and established working groups.",
14660,The Sustainability Office also introduced itself.,
14661,"“Like all of you, it seems, I am concerned about the topic of sustainability,” said the University’s president Prof. Dr. Hauke Heekeren during his welcome speech at the Stabi.",
14662,“Universität Hamburg has a good and long tradition in this area.,
14663,It is a pioneer in sustainability at universities.,
14664,We want to continue with this pathbreaking role.,
14665,We want the University to stand for sustainability in accordance with the title of our Excellence grant application:,
14666,Innovating and Cooperating for a Sustainable Future.,
14667,This also means that we also assume responsibility for this issue in the larger region and wish to proceed with other stakeholders.”,
14668,"Throughout the plenum, there will be short reports about existing sustainability activities at Universität Hamburg.",
14669,"For example, Prof. Dr. Frank Adloff introduced the work of his research group, The Futures of Sustainability.",
14670,"Dr. Jessica Engels, the University’s climate protection manager since May 2022, talked about creating a greenhouse-gas emission budget for the University for the years since 2019.",
14671,"Theresa Rötzel, research associate in the Cluster of Excellence CLICCS, talked about her job creating sustainable conference management for universities since December 2022.",
14672,"And Julia Gelbhaar (green office in the Knowledge Exchange Agency (in German only)) and Jonas Evers (AStA—student council) sketched student activities related to sustainability, from regular exchange with the Studierendenwerk and sustainable student diets to the work in the student council’s own climate section (in German only).",
14673,"Participants developed ideas, questions, and demands at 11 thematic tables (including on climate strategy, building and renovating, sustainable food, green and responsible IT and internationalization).",
14674,The concerns and ideas should be followed up in the future.,
14675,Lists were also distributed so that participants could sign up.,
14676,"Under the leadership of the Sustainability Office, a working group should be established that will meet once or twice a semester.",
14677,The open plenum on sustainability will also take place regularly.,
14678,Hauke Heekeren emphasized his delight about the fact that the University has gained a new professor of business administration with a focus in sustainable economics and a chief sustainability office (CSO) in the person of Laura Marie Edinger-Schons the University.,
14679,Edinger-Schons and her team began their work on 1 December 2022.,
14680,“We see ourselves playing a moderating role.,
14681,"Sustainability should take place in all areas of Universität Hamburg and we moderate that,” said Edinger-Schons.",
14682,"She continued to say that sustainability goes far beyond climate protection, even if Universität Hamburg is scheduled to complete a climate protection concept by the middle of this year.",
14683,"Other topics, however, such as sustainability in teaching, are just as important.",
14684,"While preparing for the plenum, she said, she had registered these concerns in all areas of the University.",
14685,"“The overarching goal is that we can all say in a few years that sustainability is actively pursued here.”
",
14686,Where does an artwork come from?,
14687,"Who traded or plundered it, or who might have destroyed it?",
14688,And to whom does it rightfully belong?,
14689,Provenance research is an art history discipline concerned with the origins of art objects.,
14690,"At Universität Hamburg, Gesa Jeuthe has been appointed to the Liebelt Professorship for Historical and Contemporary Provenance Research, making her the first professor of provenance research nationwide.",
14691,"The junior professor told us why her area of research garners so much attention, about her plans at the University, and about the challenges of establishing this new discipline.",
14692,"Ultimately, provenance research is not really new.",
14693,It was always a part of art history with the aim of ascertaining the authenticity and value of art works.,
14694,"The 1998 Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, however, shifted the focus.",
14695,The conference’s signatory countries agreed to identify art confiscated by the National Socialists as such and to find both the rightful heirs and just solutions.,
14696,"Since then, questions of changing ownership, trade routes, and their historical contexts have played an ever-larger role and led to the creation of an autonomous discipline.",
14697,"Of course, for victims with restitution claims, meaning the right to request the return of artworks, this is a long time, but provenance research is not something new.",
14698,Museums have been doing it for a long time.,
14699,Twenty years is actually a relatively short period of time for establishing independent professorships for provenance research.,
14700,"After the conference, people underestimated how extensive provenance research would become.",
14701,"They thought that checking the inventories of artwork confiscated by the National Socialists would take only 2 or 3 years per museum, but it soon became clear that the research couldn’t possibly be done in such a brief period.",
14702,"Now that provenance research has been established at the University, we can lay the as yet incomplete scholarly foundation and implement a curriculum.",
14703,Current provenance research has no standard for defining the origins of an artwork.,
14704,"At the moment, we just list the chain of owners without documentation or context and at the author’s stylistic discretion.",
14705,"This is why the Hamburg Association of Provenance Research is developing guidelines: Every chain of provenance should be scientifically comprehensible, meaning that sources must be cited in a footnote.",
14706,"These guidelines are important and practical but they don’t solve another problem, namely that there is no central, comprehensible and comprehensive registry of current provenance research on a give artwork.",
14707,"At the moment, a provenance researcher needs to research every clue to a specific provenance, e.g., an art dealer, anew, although another institution may have already done this research.",
14708,This is inefficient.,
14709,So my goal is to cooperate with various institutions to create a system for managing provenance research.,
14710,My professorship is designed to span epochs.,
14711,"As I specialize in the art market, I would like primarily to study Hamburg’s art market, which has not really been considered.",
14712,"Since last winter semester, the Hamburger Kunsthalle and I have also offered a 4-semester series of seminars on the Museum’s former collection.",
14713,"We look at works that for sundry reasons no longer belong to the collection—for example, perhaps the National Socialists confiscated “degenerate art” in 1937.",
14714,"Last summer, our goal was to develop plausible scenarios and sound hypothesis with our students about who could have handled a given artwork: Which art dealers or governmental institutions come into question?",
14715,What were their typical trading practices or who were their business partners?,
14716,"In the summer semester, we’ll focus on buying and trading from 1919 through the 1960s and look at the circumstances in which people voluntarily handed over artworks.",
14717,"For many students, by the way, the approaches we take in provenance research are unusual.",
14718,The questions that interest provenance researchers are not necessarily of an art historical nature.,
14719,"Of course, provenance researchers need a basic understanding of artworks and the art world, but we don’t engage in traditional image analysis.",
14720,We ask instead: How many versions of this work are there?,
14721,Did the picture always have this frame?,
14722,What can I ascertain from labels?,
14723,Who could have possessed this object?,
14724,"As a provenance researcher, you don’t need only a basic understanding of the object, you also need an understanding of archives, how to analyze sources, the law, and historical and economic issues.",
14725,"Ultimately, our findings are interesting for art historians.",
14726,So provenance research is highly interdisciplinary.,
14727,I myself have studied business administration in addition to art history and I ended up in provenance research by way of art market research.,
14728,Hamburg is special because the Hamburger Kunsthalle is one of the first museums to have created a permanent position for provenance research.,
14729,"So Hamburg also has Germany’s longest-serving provenance researcher, Ute Haug.",
14730,It’s incredibly fortunate that Universität Hamburg has also now established the first professorship for provenance research.,
14731,Establishing the discipline at a university fosters the interdisciplinary work it requires.,
14732,"Here in Hamburg there are several departments and institutions that I would like to work with: alongside historians and economics, there is, for example, Hamburg’s Post-Colonial Legacy research center and the Walter A. Berendsohn research center for German exile literature, the Institute for the History of the German Jews, and, of course, countless museums.
",
14733,The University’s fast-track program gives outstanding students an opportunity to do their doctorate right after completing their bachelor’s.,
14734,They receive funding and support for 2 years.,
14735,"As part of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments, Universität Hamburg is expanding its fast-track program.",
14736,"The program started in summer 2020 as a pilot project in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences.",
14737,"In the second phase, students in the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Business Administration (Hamburg Business School) will also have an opportunity to apply.",
14738,"Funding recipients receive €1,300 per month for 2 years.",
14739,They also complete their master’s while working on their doctorate.,
14740,"In addition to funding, the program includes an extensive range of qualification and networking opportunities organized by the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences and the Hamburg Research Academy (HRA).",
14741,The first 4 recipients are: Applicants were required to number among the top 15 percent or top 10 percent of their bachelor’s class (Department of Chemistry and Department of Informatics respectively).,
14742,"The upcoming computer scientists also had to demonstrate that they had received a minimum grade of 1.3 for their bachelor’s thesis.
",
14743,"Alexander Gerst (42) is not only the most famous astronaut from the Federal Republic of Germany, and, from October, the first German commander of the International Space Station (ISS), but also a Universität Hamburg graduate.",
14744,The Doctor of Geophysics is due to arrive at the ISS with his team tomorrow for the “Horizon” mission and he even has a piece of the University on board with him.,
14745,"Since working up to his odctorate from 2004 to 2010, a journey that took him all the way to the Antarctic volcano of Mount Erebus, Alexander Gerst has maintained close ties to his alma mater.",
14746,"Those ties made him proud to carry a small piece of the university with him on his second trip into space, a Universität Hamburg flag.",
14747,"He is taking this flag with him to the ISS, where he and his team will be stationed until December as part of the “Horizons” mission.",
14748,"They will be responsible for supervising approximately 300 scientific experiments, with approximately 40 coming from Germany.",
14749,"Gerst has taken part in months of training to prepare himself physically for this demanding mission, as well as practicing starting and docking the Sojus rocket.",
14750,He spent several months in space in 2014.,
14751,His doctoral supervisor has no doubts that Gerst will make an impressive commander.,
14752,"Prof. Dr. Matthias Hort from the Institute of Geophysics recalled,“While he was researching for his doctoral thesis, conducting measurements of volcanoes in the Antarctic, Asia and Central America, he always had a Plan B, and a Plan C. If, for example, an instrument was broken, he was able to make well thought-out decisions as to which option was the best to successfully get the measurements he needed.",
14753,He was always fully prepared and never left anything to chance if he could help it.”,
14754,"It was not only Gerst who had to take a barrage of tests to prove his fitness, the Universität Hamburg flag also had to pass a number of hurdles.",
14755,"The flag, in the University red with a white crest, had to be printed on extremely flame resistant material, and be sent to the European Space Agency (ESA) 6 months prior to blast off.",
14756,"There, it was thoroughly checked before being packed into the astronaut’s “luggage.”",
14757,"On his return to earth, Alexander Gerst is planning to visit Universität Hamburg:",
14758,"He, along with children’s author Cornelia Funke, are to be awarded the title of Honorary Senator of Universität Hamburg to coincide with the University’s centennial celebrations in 2019, as announced by the Academic Senate in 2017.
",
14759,"According to the Student Statistics Office 1,555 international students were enrolled in Winter Semester 2017/2018.",
14760,"During the same period the total number of international students at the University rose from 5,313 in the previous year to 5,433.",
14761,"Duy Linh Nguyen, who hails from Vietnam, is one of those students.",
14762,"In his 5th semester of the BSc program in international geography at UniversitätHamburg, Nguyen is currently doing a semester abroad in South Africa.",
14763,"When Duy Linh Nguyen’s professors take attendance at the start of every semester and struggle to pronounce his name, the young man from Vietnam often doesn’t realize they mean him.",
14764,“It just doesn’t sound like my name.,
14765,"Sometimes I notice that they are about to call me because they suddenly hesitate,” he laughs.",
14766,Going abroad has always been Linh and his family’s dream.,
14767,"Since studying in England is too expensive, it was clear from the start that Linh would go to Germany.",
14768,Linh has now lived in Hamburg for over 3 years.,
14769,"“My Vietnamese high school degree wasn’t recognized in Germany so I had to make up 2 semesters at the Studienkolleg Hamburg,” the 22-year-old student explains.",
14770,"When he finished the Studienkolleg and began studying in Winter Semester 2015/2016, he was thrilled.",
14771,"“I am interested in urban planning and climate change, so living in a major city and having the cluster of excellence ‘Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction’ (CliSAP) at the University give me a lot of opportunities.”",
14772,"To finance his studies, Linh worked as a student assistant at the CEN school, a graduate school for integrated climate and Earth system research at the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN).",
14773,"In his last 3 semesters, he also worked as a tutor, organizing intercultural events for PIASTA, the University’s internationalization program.",
14774,These take place every Wednesday at 6:30 pm during the semester.,
14775,These activities perfectly combined Linh’s intercultural skills and climate science interests.,
14776,Linh flies back to Vietnam for 2 to 4 weeks every year to see his family.,
14777,"“Then I miss Hamburg’s clear, blue skies.",
14778,In Hanoi the buildings are much taller and the streets are narrower.”,
14779,His next flight to Vietnam will take off in early 2019.,
14780,Linh is looking forward to holding his newborn niece.,
14781,"“It’s too bad that I have to miss these emotional family moments,” Linh says with a touch of regret.",
14782,"Thus, he is looking all the more forward to his graduation ceremony in summer 2019, when his parents will visit him in Hamburg for the first time.",
14783,Not only does Linh miss his family—he misses Vietnamese cuisine.,
14784,"While there are several Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg, they don’t serve the dishes you would find in Vietnam.",
14785,"Luckily, Linh is open to German cuisine.",
14786,"“If I’m hungry, I even eat green cabbage and sauerkraut!”",
14787,he laughs.,
14788,The only thing he can’t get used to is coarse brown German bread.,
14789,Linh still needs to complete 2 semesters at the Witwatersrand University in South Africa by the end of 2018.,
14790,"Once he completes his bachelor’s degree, he would like to work and become involved in various projects to gain more experience.",
14791,Only then will he decide whether or not to pursue a master’s degree.,
14792,He is still open to seeing other countries along the way.,
14793,"One thing he is sure about, however, is that he ultimately wants to go back to Vietnam.",
14794,“My goal is to bring the best from highly developed countries back to Vietnam.,
14795,"I know how things work there and there is still much to be done.
",
14796,Anna Biggs studies mathematics and physics at Harvard University.,
14797,"In 2018, the twenty-year-old completed a research internship of several months with the Emmy Noether Group of Dr. Murad Alim at the Department of Mathematics at Universität Hamburg.",
14798,Now she is back in Hamburg to finish a publication.,
14799,"With us she talked about Hamburg, string theory and male domains.",
14800,"My supervisor in the physics department at Harvard, Dr. Jacob Barandes, knows Dr. Alim.",
14801,"Since I wanted to gain international experience, he suggested that I contact him in Hamburg.",
14802,"I exchanged several mails with Dr. Alim, skyped a few times and then decided to do an internship at Universität Hamburg.",
14803,"I didnt know much about the city before I arrived, but when I came here, I liked Hamburg very much, especially the colourful building facades in St. Pauli.",
14804,Last summer I had a flat in St. Pauli – before that I had never been in a district with so much street art.,
14805,I mean graffiti as well as posters and notes on the street walls.,
14806,Thats something I find really charming.,
14807,I like the liveliness and expressiveness of St. Pauli.,
14808,"When I came to Universität Hamburg, most of my experience was shaped by the people I met in Dr. Alims group, who were extremely supportive and welcoming.",
14809,"We had a good time together.,",
14810,"At Harvard, students study a wide variety of subjects.",
14811,"In the Geomatikum, the only university building I know, everyone studies mathematics or a natural science.",
14812,"In addition, there seems to be more flexibility in the curriculum at Harvard than there is here.",
14813,"We have a few compulsory courses, but there is no fixed curriculum per semester.",
14814,"I can also take courses in history, social sciences or philosophy in addition to mathematics and physics.",
14815,Probably in my second year at university.,
14816,"I started with the idea that I wanted to do something with science, technology and mathematics, but thought maybe I’d choose philosophy or political science instead.",
14817,"So, I took part in some physics and mathematics courses and thought it was great.",
14818,Here in Hamburg I got to know research in theoretical physics and quickly found out that this kind of research was just right for me.,
14819,We are interested in paths in a complex plane that fulfill certain mathematical relationships.,
14820,"Depending on a parameter, the number of paths that fulfill this condition is either two or three.",
14821,How the number of possible paths depend on this parameter is an interesting mathematical and physical problem.,
14822,The existence of these paths is related to the existence of special particle states in string theory.,
14823,"Certainly, although not as big of a challenge as it might seem.",
14824,"My research involves a clearly defined mathematical problem and, while I don’t understand all of the string theory background, I have the mathematical knowledge to work on and understand it.",
14825,This is very similar with us: the proportion of women decreases with increasing proximity to management positions.,
14826,"In my mathematics and physics classes, for example, half to a quarter of the students are women and in the graduate school the ratio is one in ten.",
14827,"Most oppressed identities are underrepresented in math and physics though, not just women.",
14828,"Queer and trans people, most racial and ethnic minorities, and folks with disabilities do not succeed in physics at the same rate as white, heterosexual men do in the U.S. There are some programs that aim to increase the proportion of women in scientific and technical occupations.",
14829,"For example, I have completed a summer programme at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in electrical engineering and computer science, which was founded to encourage young women to study these subjects.",
14830,"At Harvard, there are different groups such as Women in Physics for students as well as doctoral students, who organise workshops, conferences and mentoring programmes.",
14831,The aim is to improve the networking of female students and to get support from older female students.,
14832,I also feel supported by a few supervisors and professors who have passionately discussed both physics and life with me.,
14833,They are interested in me and my ideas and have also invested in my education.,
14834,I’m lucky that also my parents have also been extremely supportive.,
14835,When I was struggling with math in grade school my mom helped me do a lot of my homework.,
14836,There is a scholarship at my university for students who want to complete a full-time internship abroad to gain both academic and intercultural experience –the Weissman International Internship Program Grant.,
14837,"I applied, was successful and came to Hamburg.",
14838,"After graduating, I would definitely like to do a doctorate in theoretical physics.",
14839,But I can also imagine that I will take a year to travel or take additional study courses.,
14840,"After completing my doctorate, I would ideally like to do postdoctoral research at various universities and then apply for teaching positions at colleges.
",
14841,"From 17–20 September 2019, the Department of International Affairs at Universität Hamburg invited all its all strategic and key international university partners to attend a conference at Universität Hamburg.",
14842,"The conference was attended by participants from 18 universities from 13 countries, with the goal of spurring on and increasing multilateral collaboration within the network.",
14843,"Before the conference, we put 3 questions to Dr. Joern Pütz, Deputy Vice-President for Franco-German Relations at the University of Strasbourg, who participated in the conference.",
14844,The University of Strasbourg has been a strategic partner of Universität Hamburg since 2018.,
14845,"Internationalization is very important, if we want to be able to react to the challenges of globalization.",
14846,"It promotes mobility and a more open society as well as providing academic, professional, and personal development for all staff and students.",
14847,"It also contributes to knowledge transfer and exchange, and provides an opportunity to bring innovation to research and teaching.",
14848,"On top of that, internationalization is required for academic excellence.",
14849,"Fundamentally, it is important to us to be internationally visible, and perceived as a valuable player.",
14850,"In practical terms however, we are also focused on the recognition of our degrees, like the more than 50 international dual degrees and exchanges between students, professors, and administrative staff.",
14851,This last aspect promotes multilingualism and intercultural dialog.,
14852,It is also important for us to share our academic experience and knowledge with our partners and to benefit from best practice.,
14853,Internationalization is also increasingly playing an ever more important role in funding applications.,
14854,That is best summed up with “networking with the network.”,
14855,"Working together with a number of partners at once offers many opportunities, such as the development of strategic international research projects.",
14856,"We also think that having multiple partners working together can have multiple advantages, for example with Excellence projects in teaching and research, but also when putting together expert networks and institutional lobbying.",
14857,"More than anything, networks offer an opportunity to implement bottom-up activities and projects.",
14858,"We hope that this conference will also give us some specific inspiration for the field of digitalization.
",
14859,How can we detect mite infestations of bee colonies early?,
14860,An interdisciplinary research team has developed technology that enables automated acoustic monitoring.,
14861,"For this work, the team is using one of the new coworking spaces offered by the University.",
14862,Nabil Basharat and Kevin Kraus discuss their joint creative work.,
14863,Kevin Kraus:,
14864,The starting point for finding a topic during the Digital Innovation Lab seminar was the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals.,
14865,"When I told my friend whilst brainstorming about a start-up that uses image analysis from within a beehive to monitor arriving and departing bees as well as pollen amounts, she mentioned that her mother had kept bees for a long time.",
14866,"However, they died due to the varroa mite—a type of mite that infests beehives and is one of the main causes of colony collapse worldwide.",
14867,"Even here, there are approaches that use image analysis to monitor infestations.",
14868,"We wanted to automate this technology, which proved to be extremely impractical.",
14869,Kraus:,
14870,We did further research and stumbled on the idea of using the acoustics of bees as an indicator of a colony’s health.,
14871,"It turns out that you can detect, for example, whether a queen is present by listening to the buzzing and whether there is a varroa mite infestation.",
14872,"Therefore, we opted for this monitoring approach.",
14873,"Our prototype consists of a small microcontroller (i.e., a chip) that contains various control elements and is powered by solar electricity.",
14874,It is a quasi mini PC that uses a machine-learning model to record and analyze tones.,
14875,We trained the model using recordings of bee sounds and repeatedly tested it.,
14876,That means that the device conducts the analysis directly on-site and only the results of the classification must be transferred at the end.,
14877,Kraus:,
14878,Machine learning depends greatly on the quality of the data used to train the artificial intelligence.,
14879,"Unfortunately, there is no database with audio files of different bees, for example, with a termite infestation.",
14880,We were only able to train our prototype to distinguish between bees and ambient noise.,
14881,The model still has to learn to identify the specific sound of bees infested with mites.,
14882,Nabil Basharat:,
14883,"However, we have developed a basic technology that can be installed on a beehive in order to record noises and directly process them.",
14884,It helped greatly that we come from different areas.,
14885,"Tobias Bartsch and Kevin are doing master’s degrees in information systems and took care of the software, the machine learning, and the hardware architecture.",
14886,"Also in our team was Alexia Geoffrien, an exchange student from France who contributed a marketing perspective.",
14887,"I am an industrial engineering and management student and, above all, was responsible for the design and production of the box that holds all components and is fastened to the beehive.",
14888,"For this, I used—among other things—the 3D printer in the coworking space.",
14889,Basharat:,
14890,"What was especially great was that so much hardware is available, like the 3D printer.",
14891,"In addition, it provides a lot of inspiration and potential to test developments.",
14892,You can also use the space flexibly and always have a place to meet up at the University without having to search for one.,
14893,Kraus:,
14894,"Yes, and even the large-membrane microphone and the computer components for our microcontroller were very helpful.",
14895,"Above all, however, we also used the room to exchange with other groups.",
14896,Kraus:,
14897,"So far, however, we have not had the chance to test it in practice.",
14898,"At the moment, no further development is planned following the end of the elective subject, but our development is open source.",
14899,"This means that perhaps people will be interested in further developing the prototype and implementing it.

14900,Poor grades in elementary school almost put an early end to this young man’s pursuits.,
14901,Now Mahmut Yüksel is working towards a double degree in medicine and informatics at Universität Hamburg and off to earn a medical doctorate at Harvard University.,
14902,"In the Hauptschule (lower secondary school), I was under-challenged and underestimated, so in 6th grade I changed to a Realschule (technical high school)—despite my teachers’ warnings that it was “hopeless” and I would fail.",
14903,"As expected, my grades got worse, and I only just managed to scrape through the first year with barely passing grades.",
14904,It was only after a major life-changing event during the summer holidays after 7th grade that I began to pick up my grades in 8th grade.,
14905,"When I finally got my Realschule certificate, I wanted to know what else I could achieve.",
14906,I changed to a Gymnasium (college-prep high school) and finally took my German secondary school leaving certificate—with top marks—in 2012.,
14907,"Now, I am in my 6th semester of the model degree program in medicine at Universität Hamburg, and I began my second degree in informatics in Winter Semester 2017/2018.",
14908,"I am interested in medical technology and computer-assisted neuroscience, which is why I wanted to study both medcine and informatics.",
14909,"My parents took me to visit our relatives in Turkey, and I saw the schools that my cousins were attending.",
14910,"The children there were being taught in very large composite classes, they didn’t have any books or teaching materials, and the building was not up to the standard that I knew from Germany.",
14911,"Some of the girls in the village were not allowed to go to school, even though they wanted to.",
14912,It was so unfair that they were not even getting a chance.,
14913,I suddenly realized how privileged I was.,
14914,"In medicine, it is normal to finish your doctoral dissertation while you are still studying.",
14915,"Given that it takes between 3 and 12 months, it also takes much less time than in other disciplines.",
14916,I knew that I wanted to expand my international experience.,
14917,"Harvard is particularly attractive for me, as it is one of the most renowned universities in the world, and provides very good research conditions in the field of medical imagery.",
14918,"As I got very good grades for the first part of my studies, I wanted to give it a try.",
14919,"So I applied, and I am really happy that it worked out.",
14920,The reactions are very different.,
14921,"My family, friends, and people I know from the academic world are very proud and congratulate me for this amazing opportunity.",
14922,"Former school friends are always surprised, and they keep asking me: “Are you really studying medicine?”",
14923,"In the beginning, I didn’t want to face all that skepticism.",
14924,But now I think its perfectly fine to talk about your successes.,
14925,"As they say here, “shared joy is double joy.”",
14926,", My preliminary topic is “Complexity and Connectivity in First-Episode Psychosis.”",
14927,"Using computer-assisted imaging, I want to examine the complexity and connectivity of 12 to 15 patients who are in the first phase of a psychotic episode.",
14928,"Mostly, I want to enjoy my time at Harvard, to put the German lens to one side and look at the world from a new perspective.",
14929,"Research in medical imaging is really exciting, and I hope that I meet a lot of interesting people in Boston who will have a lasting effect on my life.",
14930,"Particularly given that it is not just Americans there, but also researchers and academics from all over the world.",
14931,I just think the environment there will be amazing.,
14932,Right now I plan to do my written exams in 2021.,
14933,"After that, I can imagine doing a clinical year in neuroscience, psychiatry, or cardiology.",
14934,I have also considered doing an American medical degree—the United States Medical Licensing Examination.,
14935,Unless my start-up that I founded with four friends takes off (laughs).,
14936,We are developing an eLearning platform for first-year students who need to prepare for the medical entrance exam.,
14937,I would especially like to encourage people from immigrant backgrounds It’s not important where you come from or what other think you can or cannot do.,
14938,Germany offers so much educational opportunity that you should appreciate and use to your advantage.,
14939,"Upon the recommendation of my technical high school teacher I successfully applied to the Startstiftung, a scholarship program for school students from immigrant backgrounds.",
14940,"It provided me for the 3 years up to my Abitur with a laptop, a monthly allowance, and a budget for materials and language courses.",
14941,In total I have received 9 different scholarships.,
14942,"Among other things, they made it possible for me to take language courses abroad and attend a neuroscience summer school in Texas.",
14943,I am now active in the foundation Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes as a goodwill ambassador for equal opportunity.,
14944,"My job is to inform students about the support they can receive.
",
14945,"From April 2021, 17 researchers at Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence will receive funding from the Ideas and Venture Fund.",
14946,The researchers will use this to prepare larger third-party-funded projects suited to one of the University’s profile initiatives or emerging fields.,
14947,"In total, the University will have around €440,000 at its disposal.",
14948,"Here, we introduce 2 projects.",
14949,"In 1992, the European Union adopted the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.",
14950,Its goal is to protect European languages that are only spoken by a minority of people.,
14951,"In northern Germany, this applies to Frisian and Low German.",
14952,"“Nevertheless, the situation is dramatic: the number of speakers continues to decline,” says Prof. Dr. Ingrid Schröder, a linguist.",
14953,"In her new research project, she wants to find out how different generations value these languages; what they associate with these languages; and whether, with whom, and on which occasions they speak these languages.",
14954,"It is also important that Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Schleswig-Holstein, and Hamburg all signed the charter and work to preserve the regional languages in northern Germany.",
14955,"For instance, they fund cultural institutions or offer language courses at schools as a required elective subject.",
14956,"“We now want to examine which of the measures promise success,” says Schröder.",
14957,"“Ultimately, we want to know what can convince young people to learn these languages when everyone around them speaks High German.",
14958,Is it possible to reverse the trend?,
14959,Or will Low German and Frisian be lost in the foreseeable future?”,
14960,"Prof. Dr. Schröder has been granted €24,930 in funding.",

14966,"Singer wants to bring the funding recipients and the public together on-site to work out how art, science and scholarship, nature, and local narratives can be connected.",
14967,The objective is to develop new perspectives for complex challenges such as the climate crisis or biodiversity loss.,
14968,"“Those are global problems that present significant challenges to science and scholarship at all levels,” says Singer.",
14969,“Only when the existing forms of knowledge acquisition are expanded and recognized as being equal to traditional scientific methods can local signposts emerge that inspire globally.”,
14970,"For Singer, the root of the problems mentioned lie in the rational, user-oriented view of nature that prevails in Europe.",

14983,"With a look at the Europe of the future, Levits summarized his views as a scientist and as a politician with confidence: “Europe will be as Europe should be.”",
14984,"He was already scheduled to speak at Universität Hamburg on 24 February 2022, but that was the day that the war in Ukraine began and Levits returned to his country posthaste.",
14985,"On 28 April 2023, he was finally able to make a return visit and give his address.",
14986,"Prof. Dr. Hauke Heekeren, president of Universität Hamburg, touched upon the events in his welcome speech: “The last 14 months mark a turning point in European policy and are shaped by the fundamental questions about how the Forum will face and discuss it: What holds Europe together, and how, in the face of this attack on a sovereign nation?",
14987,"What does the future of Europe as a community bound by laws and values look like, what is the status of Europe’s strategic sovereignty?”",

14997,"For the first time, Universität Hamburg was also a new building’s building contractor.",
14998,Universität Hamburg’s Haus der Lehre—Light & Schools has been recognized as the 2020 building of the year by the Architekten- und Ingenieurverein Hamburg (AIV).,
14999,The prize has been awarded on 11 November.,
15000,"“The building is a wonderful place for building bridges between university research and schools,” said Prof. Dr. Klaus Sengstock, who initiated the building.",
15001,"Ten years ago, the head of the Institute of Laser Physics decided to create an extraordinary learning site where young people could gain insight into physics.",
15002,"The goal was to inspire enthusiasm for and an understanding of the natural sciences outside the classroom and without grades—ideally, the inspiration lasts when young people start careers.",
15003,"In the last few years, this has led to physics-related projects for young people of practically all ages: Light & Schools—a school lab for elementary and secondary school children—and an advanced internship in the Department of Physics.",
15004,Elementary and secondary school students can learn from one another here because the transparent labs allow groups to get a glimpse of what other groups are working on.,
15005,"Thanks to the modern equipment, they can engage in experimental work and conduct current research such as that being done at The Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging (CUI): Cluster of Excellence Advance Imaging of Matter, which also funds the school lab.",
15006,"At the same time, the extensive glass facade of the one-story building on Luruper Chaussee piques the interest of passersby and gives them a glimpse of science.",
15007,"The architect Fiona Krauß, vice chair of the AIV, called the reconstruction of the building and the integration of 2 pine trees as central features of the exterior a masterpiece.",
15008,"“As if they were on a stage, they give form with their lives and their growth to light and its energy and this form changes in space and through time, as do all living things.",
15009,"At the same time, this thoughtful architectural gesture, realized by everyone involved with the utmost care and appreciation, shows respect for nature,” said Krauß in her laudatory speech.",
15010,This notable feature and the open construction not only makes the building an eye-catcher; it also marks a further step on the path toward Science City Bahrenfeld.,
15011,"For the first time, Universität Hamburg was also the building contractor.",
15012,The architectural firm hammeskrause was responsible for the building design.,
15013,"In addition to the prize from the AIV, which recognizes the outstanding cooperation between the building contractor, the architects, and the engineers, the building and architecture firm received the “best architects award” in the building design category.",
15014,The German Sustainable Building Council awarded silver and the building also gained significant attention at the architecture and engineering days in Hamburg.,
15015,“I would like once again and on behalf of the entire Light & Schools team to express my thanks to Universität Hamburg for financing this wonderful building for Science City and all schoolchildren in the upcoming years.,
15016,"I thank our property management for their fabulous commitment, the department, the dean, and the head of administration for their support and the entire architectural team at hammeskrause for their ingenious design!” said Prof. Sengstock.

15020,The Department of International Affairs at Universität Hamburg is organizing the Hamburg Networking Conference (HNC) for the second time from 18 to 22 October.,
15021,Universität Hamburgs strategic and thematic international university partners are invited.,
15022,Participants from 23 universities from 16 countries will attend digitally.,
15023,The goal is to spur on and increase multilateral collaboration within the network.,
15024,"Three questions for Robert Kotzé, responsible for the topic of internationalization at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, which will also take part in the Hamburg Networking Conference (HNC).",
15025,International collaboration is important for delivering quality education on all levels and to contribute to the global knowledge economy.,
15026,"On the level of learning and teaching, it is important for developing the global skills and intercultural awareness of incoming and outgoing students, enhancing their employability.",
15027,"On the level of research and innovation, it is important for building strong research groups and bringing (complementary) expertise together to address global issues.",
15028,"And on the level of social impact, it is important for local, regional and continental development, especially for an institution based in Africa, like Stellenbosch University.",
15029,The opportunity lies in the word “networking”.,
15030,"Yes, it is about a group of universities sharing experiences and talking about opportunities – a network.",
15031,But it is more about the action of networking:,
15032,"The 2019 opened doors to new bilateral partners, which unfortunately could not be exploited to the full – the pandemic forced us all to look a bit inwards– some navel-gazing, and we are only now building momentum to “build back better”.",
15033,"The upcoming HNC has the potential to provide that space we need, albeit virtually.",
15034,We should use the opportunities to build new and to strengthen partnership capital.,
15035,"I am linking it to the topics in the programme:
",
15036,"Since the coronavirus took hold in Germany, those who come into contact with the deceased have had many questions.",
15037,Are the bodies of the victims contagious?,
15038,How significant is the danger?,
15039,Can we protect ourselves?,
15040,Dr. med.,
15041,Antonia Fitzek of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf has answers.,
15042,"Every other day, Antonia Fitzek, Julia Schädler and other employees of the Institute of Legal Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf visit crematoriums in Hamburg to carry out a second inquest of bodies scheduled for cremation.",
15043,"“When we spoke to crematorium employees or funeral professionals at churches over the past year, we noticed a great deal of anxiety,” she said.",
15044,Why?,
15045,"“People in those professions come into physical contact with the deceased, but they have no medical training, so they do not know how to protect themselves from infectious diseases.",
15046,They were largely forgotten in discussions about handling the pandemic.”,
15047,"Together with her colleagues, the junior doctor decided to conduct a systematic study into the potential risk of contagion from the deceased.",
15048,"In the spring of 2020, virtually no comparable analyses had been carried out in Europe.",
15049,"While medical professionals already assumed that the coronavirus spread through droplets, there was still uncertainty as to whether touching the skin of the deceased, body bags or coffins might pose a danger of infection.",
15050,Samples taken from the bodies of the dead were to provide insight into the risk of infection The study was launched in the summer of 2020 using funding granted to Universität Hamburg within the scope of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.,
15051,A team of forensic pathologists examined 33 deceased persons from Hamburg in whose nose and throat samples PCR tests had detected the coronavirus.,
15052,"Fitzek explained: “We also took five skin samples from each body, for example, from the mouth area, where it seems likely that virus particles might have accumulated.",
15053,But we also examined their shoulders and arms: areas that the funeral professionals touch frequently.”,
15054,"Many of the skin samples contained virus fragments, but the researchers were unable to cultivate the viruses in the laboratory, i.e., cause them to reproduce.",
15055,Successful reproduction would have suggested a risk of infection.,
15056,“None of the skin samples contained virus material that we were able to cultivate.,
15057,This shows that touching skin is highly unlikely to be contagious.,
15058,"Professionals can handle the dead without anxiety, provided that they wear suitable PPE.”",
15059,Blood tests detect recovery Antonia Fitzek and Julia Schädler went one step further for their study.,
15060,They took blood samples from employees of cemeteries and funeral homes to find out how many of them had already recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection—quite possibly without being aware of it.,
15061,The researchers also asked them about their worries and hopes.,
15062,The survey showed that nearly half of the 56 study participants did not feel sufficiently informed at the end of last year.,
15063,"While there was plenty of PPE available, nearly a third of respondents stated that they did not wear them consistently at work.",
15064,No reasons were given.,
15065,Some wished for external controls.,
15066,Many people suspected that they had already recovered from an undiagnosed infection with the coronavirus.,
15067,"The analysis of their blood samples showed a different result, however: “Only two percent of those examined already had antibodies in their blood.",
15068,"This corresponds to the average among the general population,” Fitzek told us.",
15069,The result supported her conclusion that the risk of infection from handling the bodies of coronavirus victims correctly and professionally is not nearly as high as feared.,
15070,The results may change how the dead are handled—by relatives as well as professionals,
15071,The funeral professionals were very relieved to learn about the results of the study.,
15072,"Its insights may benefit relatives of the deceased, too: at the moment, they have to observe very strict rules.",
15073,"They are not allowed to go near the deceased; in most cases, they are not even allowed to see them again.",
15074,“That’s a very sad state of affairs.,
15075,"Saying goodbye at the coffin is an important part of the grieving process for many,” Fitzek said.",
15076,"“In my opinion, our study results show that the current rules can be reconsidered.”",
15077,Dr. med.,
15078,"Antonia Fitzek received €10,000 in funding from the Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence initiative.",
15079,The ‘Mehr Weitblick nach der Coronavirus-Krise’ (a broader perspective after the coronavirus crisis) fund is financed through the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.,

15081,"Additional publications are in preparation.
",
15082,"Effective immediately, Universität Hamburg is funding 5 research projects as part of the Next Generation Partnerships—Thematic Networks program.",
15083,The funding is earmarked for the preparation of long-term external funding projects.,
15084,One of the projects focuses on changes in written language as a result of digitalization.,
15085,"In our globalized and digitalized world, the written word serves purposes different from those of a generation ago.",
15086,"“When people write to each other using smartphones and laptops, it’s more about interaction and exchange than about imparting information,” explains Jannis Androutsopoulos, linguist at Universität Hamburg.",
15087,"“In these cases, typed characters have to take on the functions usually transfered by voice, gesture, and facial expression in direct communication.",
15088,This is why people often change digital writing.,
15089,They are adapting it to their communication needs.”,
15090,"According to Androutsopoulos, the German “Tchuligom” for Entschuldigung, “büdde” for bitte, and “!!1elf” (“elf” means eleven in German, with the whole combination being a parody of unsuccessful attempts to type multiple exclamation points) are typical for written words intended to transport emotional or social meaning in digital communication: ineptitude, emphasis, or dialectic nuances through which the writer reveals something about his or her personal background when typing the message.",
15091,Jannis Androutsopoulos and Heike Zinsmeister from the Institute for German Language and Literature would like to spend the next 3 years studying the ways that digital writing changes writing systems in different languages.,
15092,"The Hamburg researchers will cooperate with scientists and scholars from Indiana University, University of Luxembourg, Utrecht University, and King’s College London to analyze, in addition to German language data, English, Dutch, Luxembourgian, Greek, and Chinese language data.",
15093,"“The last two languages are especially exciting because they have different writing systems,” says Androutsopoulos.",
15094,"For example, in Chinese, doubling letters or writing in capitals is not possible.",
15095,“We are eager to see whether in this language writers have similar impulses to make linguistic changes similar to those in German or English.”,
15096,"Methodologically, the linguists want to sound out the synergies of qualitative and quantitative procedures.",
15097,They are relying on computer linguistic evaluation procedures in order to assess large quantities of data and on ethnographic methods to interpret writing variations in context.,
15098,They will take the data from social media as well as from private chats.,
15099,The researchers will concentrate especially on emotional issues.,
15100,"“You can observe the communicative rituals for celebrating and mourning in which users sound out the expressive possibilities of written language especially well in social media,” says Androutsopoulos.

15101,The mangrove inventory on the Fiji Islands: Burkhart Brielmaier and Sarah Reimer spent 4 months in the South Pacific island nation to record and measure the biomass of mangroves.,
15102,Photo: Brielmaier/Reimer They were often assisted by local forest officers and students.,
15103,Photo: Brielmaier/Reimer Wooden biomass of the mangroves found in sample areas measuring 3 x 3 meters was sawn into pieces and weighed.,
15104,"Photo: Brielmaier/Reimer Tropical climate, mosquitos, and the musty smell of the muddy ground: no problem for these wood science students.",
15105,"Mangroves, salt-water tolerant trees with characteristically high root systems, grow all along the coast of the South Pacific island of Fiji.",
15106,Yet the data we have on how these mangrove forests store carbon is sparse.,
15107,"Fiji, the Pacific nation taking the lead in climate change, is at pains to close this gap.",
15108,"Burkhart Brielmeier and Sarah Reimer, two master’s students in wood science at Universität Hamburg, spent 4 months in Fiji in order to develop a method for recording the biomass of mangrove forests and evaluating their carbon-storage capacity.",
15109,Burkhart Brielmaier: To develop a method enabling us to create an inventory of the mangrove forests on Fiji so that we can calculate their capacity to store carbon.,
15110,"To do so, we had to record the biomass within pre-defined areas.",
15111,Sarah Reimer:,
15112,"A further task was to familiarize the local forestry officers and students with our method so that, in theory, the inventory can continue without our being present and it will be possible to carry out a national mangrove inventory.",
15113,BB:,
15114,"In our research, we work with so-called transects and we only take into account the wooden biomass above ground: that means no leaves and no roots under the soil.",
15115,4 months would be far too short for recording an entire plant.,
15116,"The sample areas in the transects measure 3 x 3 meters each, with a distance of 50 meters between each sample area.",
15117,SR: The most widespread mangrove species Rhizophora spp. grows like a weed.,
15118,"At most locations, it was impossible to say where the tree started and ended.",
15119,This mangrove species also entwines itself with other trees and doesn’t develop a true trunk.,
15120,"That is why it is not possible to determine the number of trees per area, as we would do in a conventional inventory.",
15121,"For this reason, we used a method known as “destructive sampling.”",
15122,"Basically, we documented our sample areas and then we chopped them up and weighed them.",
15123,"Instead of using measuring the volume, we evaluated density to estimate the wooden biomass.",
15124,"Once we have the biomass, we can then calculate the level of carbon.",
15125,BB:,
15126,"In the Kyoto Protocol as well as at the Cop23, the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn , and many other climate change meetings, the leading industrial nations have promised to help developing countries with climate change.",
15127,"If, for example, the German federal government would like to support mangrove conservation on Fiji, we first need to know more about the importance of the mangrove forests.",
15128,"Without well-founded knowledge of the positive effects on the climate, no money will flow.",
15129,"SR: Moreover, mangrove forests are a very important ecosystem: They purify water, transport biomass into the ocean—which is important for corals—and provide us humans with medicines or firewood.",
15130,"They also serve many fish species, such as sharks, as a breeding ground.",
15131,"And because they prevent erosion, they are also very important for coastline conservation.",
15132,SR: The social aspect plays a very important role.,
15133,"On Fiji, as on other Pacific islands, communities are governed by the “chief system.”",
15134,This means that you need to introduce yourself in the village to whom the mangrove forest belongs.,
15135,"This takes place in a ritual called the Sevu Sevu, in which you state your intentions and offer a kava root.",
15136,"If the chief accepts the kava root, then you have been accepted as a member of the village and are free to carry out whatever you stated.",
15137,Most of the time the chief gave us a boat with a guide who took us to our sample areas.,
15138,BB:,
15139,Professor Dr. Michael Köhl from wood science asked us if we were interested.,
15140,He has contacts in the German development agency GIZ (Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH).,
15141,"Our project was part of the REED+ Program (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries).",
15142,BB:,
15143,It is difficult to compare the two.,
15144,Central European mixed forests are subject to heavy commercial use and are far removed from their natural states.,
15145,"Conversely, the mangroves build a highly sensitive ecosystem and are largely untouched by humans.",
15146,Here nature has adapted to the most extreme conditions.,
15147,"And as such, working in the mangroves is an extreme experience.",
15148,"The tropical climate, the mosquitos, and the musty smell of the muddy ground add a particular flavor to our work: an Eldorado for any adventurer.
",
15149,Leonard Borchert’s goal is to make weather forecasts for the next 10 years more accurate.,
15150,"To do so, he has observed the North Atlantic, which strongly influences the weather in Europe.",
15151,Borchert’s findings have now been published in the Journal of Climate.,
15152,"As a PhD candidate at CEN, he also knows when good forecasts simply aren’t possible.",
15153,Playground—large—complex.,
15154,"They allow me to play with the laws of nature without doing any harm, and to learn something in the process.",
15155,"They are highly relevant for politicians and farmers, as well as insurers.",
15156,"For example, less than average rainfall could cause a drought, or there could be a higher risk of hurricanes.",
15157,"10-year forecasts are also known as decadal forecasts, and they are situated between weather forecasts and climate projections.",
15158,"For a good weather forecast, it is important to know exactly what the current weather is like.",
15159,This information can be used together with parameters like wind direction to predict the weather for up to five days into the future—but not much more.,
15160,"Yes, here timespans of 30 years or more are interesting.",
15161,Large-scale physical processes are included in the climate models.,
15162,What is the proportion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?,
15163,How are land and sea ice developing?,
15164,"For a 10-year forecast, I need to combine the two different approaches.",
15165,This is technically possible—the problem is the results: the forecasts aren’t particularly accurate.,
15166,"We test the models using retrospective forecasts, also known as “hindcasts.”",
15167,"To do so, we have the models forecast the weather for multiple timespans in the past for which we already have reliable meteorological records.",
15168,We then compare how well the forecasts measure up to the recorded data.,
15169,"On this basis, we can calculate a “quality index” of sorts.",
15170,The index currently ranges between 0.5 and 0.6 for the 10-year forecasts—which makes them slightly better that guessing.,
15171,A 1.0 would be a perfect score.,
15172,"My latest was 0.8, which is practically sensational.",
15173,The problem is the quality index.,
15174,"It consists of several components, such as water temperature, air temperature, and wind currents, which are combined to assess the quality of the forecast.",
15175,"But, for example, the effects of the individual factors could cancel each other out.",
15176,I deconstructed the index and considered only one factor: heat transport in the North Atlantic.,
15177,"The weather in Europe is greatly influenced by the Gulf Stream, which transports heat here on its way north.",
15178,"And as we can see, this factor also has a major impact on the quality of forecasts.",
15179,My calculations show that good forecasts can only be made when the ocean either transports an especially large amount of heat—or an especially small amount—at the beginning of the forecast period.,
15180,"If the water temperatures are moderate, the forecast won’t be very accurate.",
15181,"The same applies to the amounts of water transported: if it’s particularly large or small, the forecast quality will be good, but with more moderate values it will likely be poor.",
15182,Exactly.,
15183,"Either the models aren’t yet good enough, or the climate itself hasn’t made its mind up as to how it will develop on the basis of these moderate conditions.",
15184,"For instance, a typical, reliable forecast would be: the risk of a hurricane hitting Northern Europe within the next 8 to 10 years has risen considerably.",
15185,But I can’t make a forecast like: a hurricane will hit Lower Saxony in April 2026.,
15186,Hopefully they’ll encourage the community to reconsider current scientific practices.,
15187,"After all, it’s just a first example for the North Atlantic.",
15188,"We could also investigate heat transport in other regions, like for the recurring climate phenomenon El Niño.",
15189,"Here, more accurate forecasts would be of global interest.
",
15190,Further internationalization is one of Universität Hamburg’s most important goals in the Excellence Strategy.,
15191,Yet how can we best cooperate with our many partner institutions during the pandemic?,
15192,Regina Siemß from the Department of International Affairs took part in several digital workshops on the search for solutions.,
15193,"The 3 workshops, to which we invited 24 partner universities in May, are a continuation of the analog Hamburg Networking Conference (HNC).",
15194,This 2-day conference took place for the first time last September.,
15195,We set this up so that we could regularly discuss ideas for cooperation with various partner institutions.,
15196,The next HNC will take place in fall 2021.,
15197,"Thanks to the coronavirus, however, a lot has changed.",
15198,"On the one hand, cooperation has become more difficult due to the worldwide restrictions.",
15199,"On the other hand, an event like the pandemic shows just how important international cooperation is.",
15200,That’s why we decided rather spontaneously to conduct a digital HNC.,
15201,Eighty-five participants accepted the invitation.,
15202,This shows how great the need is.,
15203,We exchanged a lot of ideas about how individual universities deal with the challenges presented by the pandemic.,
15204,"For example, Indiana University (USA) reported on their Global Classroom project.",
15205,It is using the currently required digitalization to offer more courses with international experts.,
15206,"Macquarie University in Australia reported on how the entire enrollment process and initial research activities, including for doctoral students abroad, have been digitalized.",
15207,The different partners can learn a lot from these good practice examples.,
15208,I am surprised that both the technical side of things and the culture of participation and discourse worked so well.,
15209,But a digital workshop requires even better preparation than its analog counterpart.,
15210,"For example, you have to precisely clarify in advance who is going to moderate each part and how the various conversation partners are going to alternate.",
15211,And supervising the workshops was complex.,
15212,I took over the technical moderation and colleagues took care of handling the topics.,
15213,"Furthermore, you need 2 or 3 people to oversee the chat.",
15214,"With 50 to 60 participants per workshop, this is a challenge—but one that we mastered.",
15215,No.,
15216,"I think we’ll try a mix with analog formats and, in the future, a real conference here in Hamburg every 2 years— because in my opinion a digital format cannot completely replace the direct contact and informal chats in the coffee break that are part and parcel of a networking event.",
15217,"Nonetheless, digital meetings are a wonderful way of staying in contact and deepening partnerships and we will definitely be using them in the future.

15218,Scientists in the Faculty of Medicine and the Departments of Chemistry and Biology at Universität Hamburg investigate the role of signaling molecules in inflammatory diseases in the Collaborative Research Center “Adenine Nucleotides in Immunity and Inflammation” (CRC 1328).,
15219,The Collaborative Research Center has been awarded 11.4 million euros by the German Research Foundation (DFG).,
15220,Spokesperson of the CRC is Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Guse from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).,
15221,"To fight pathogenic organisms, the body activates its immune system.",
15222,The immune system attacks and disarms the intruder.,
15223,Yet sometimes the body is unable to differentiate between the body’s own cells and pathogenic organisms such as viruses or bacteria.,
15224,"All of a sudden the immune system attacks healthy tissue, resulting in chronic inflammation.",
15225,Millions of people living in Germany suffer from inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Crohn’s disease.,
15226,"For many sufferers, there is no prospect of a cure.",
15227,We do not even know definitively how many of these diseases develop.,
15228,Scientists in the new collaborative research center will investigate the molecular and cellular processes that take place at the emergence of inflammatory disease and when immune reactions are triggered.,
15229,The aim is to research the role of signaling molecules—the so-called adenine nucleotides—in inflammation processes.,
15230,"Adenine nucleotides influence a range of processes within cells: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), for example, stores energy and regulates energy transfer processes.",
15231,"Another, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), is of central importance in metabolism.",
15232,“Adenine nucleotides are present both within and outside of cells.,
15233,"However, many of these internal and external cellular functions are not known.",
15234,"It is also not yet clear which regulatory influence they have on inflammation processes in the body,” says Prof. Dr. Chris Meier from the Department of Chemistry and co-spokesperson of the CRC 1328.",
15235,“The Collaborative Research Centre poses a unique opportunity for us to extensively explore these fundamental processes and use our findings to develop new diagnostic and potentially also new therapeutic methods.”,
15236,"In CRC 1328, scientists from the Departments of Chemistry and Biology collaborate with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine at Universität Hamburg.",
15237,"The universities in Göttingen, Bonn, and Munich are also involved.",
15238,"“Cooperation between the various disciplines and departments enables us to dovetail basic research in the natural sciences and clinical medicine in order to answer complicated questions relating to molecular processes,” explains Prof. Meier.",
15239,"“The strong interdisciplinary approach means that we have the most diverse range of research methods from biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, bioinformatics, and structural biology at our disposal.”",
15240,Collaborative research centers are initiated by the German Research Foundation and may receive funding for a maximum of three funding rounds or 12 years.,
15241,"CRC 1328 has been awarded initial funding of 11.4 million for 4 years.

15242,"As a part of The Hamburg Forum for Global Science and Policy, Universität Hamburg and the Hamburg Institute for Advanced Study (HIAS) invite to the conference Why Research in Internationalization Matters on 16 and 17 May 2023 in Hamburg.",
15243,"Volatile geopolitical dynamics, combined with the global COVID-19 pandemic, have forced and are forcing universities and research institutions as well as policymakers to re-adjust much of what was previously thought of as ‘standard’ in research.",
15244,"The new normal is that there is no normal: The post-pandemic landscape of higher education and its governance, and, thusly, research, looks very different than it did in 2019.",
15245,Research on these new challenges facing the internationalization of research is as of yet not sufficiently explored.,
15246,"Why Research in Internationalization Matters is initiating a new discourse with international and internationally oriented researchers, research managers and university leaders to examine these questions.",
15247,The kick-off conference is taking place in Hamburg on 16/17 May 2023.,

15251,"Internet TV and linear TV—both are here to stay, according to Prof. Dr. Joan Kristin Bleicher.",
15252,"The TV expert has just published a new book on the history of internet TV and explains the strategies traditional TV is now pursuing, the dangers posed by AI, and what schools should do.",
15253,“Traditional TV is in a period of transition.,
15254,"A new competitor that integrates all of TV’s previous media poses huge challenges,” explains Prof. Joan Bleicher, managing director of the Institute of Media and Communications at Universität Hamburg.",
15255,"“There are, of course, many prognoses about the death of traditional TV, but in my view, it will exist alongside internet TV, with a different focus.”",
15256,"Internet TV, says Bleicher, integrates both traditional TV formats as well as its own range of moving images; in the various areas of international research on the topic, the blanket term “internet TV” has been agreed upon to summarize the diverse range of moving images offered by the internet.",
15257,"“This includes, among other things, video-stream providers such as Netflix, video platforms such as YouTube, and diverse video phenomena on social media.",
15258,"And this all, of course, competes with traditional TV.",
15259,"Stations need to think about how they are going to respond,” says the Universität Hamburg media expert.",
15260,"One strategy according to Bleicher: “If you can’t beat the competition, integrate it.”",
15261,"Thus, she continues, there is an entire series of programs on TV based on YouTube videos or Instagram.",
15262,"Furthermore, she says, traditional TV focuses on its core competencies, for example entertainment; this has led in the past few years to a nostalgic TV trend.",
15263,"Prof. Joan Bleicher: “One example of this is the return of old shows such as ‘Wetten, dass...?’",
15264,or previously successful programs.,
15265,Then there is the strategy of adhering to good old TV news programs that remain believable because they are based on well-researched facts and provide a counterpoint to the fake news found on social media.”,
15266,It is hardly surprising that studies conducted by TV stations ARD and ZDF have found that there is a generation gap when it comes to using the various offers.,
15267,"Older viewers generally remain true to traditional TV while children and adolescents often no longer have any interest in linear TV, preferring social media, YouTube, Netflix, or other streaming services.",
15268,This is why Bleicher advocates for more strongly promoting media competence in schools: “It is not only children and adolescents who should be schooled in the use of these media but also their teachers because many of them still think TikTok is a game.,
15269,They are often very skeptical of media and are not very willing to engage with it.,
15270,Perhaps a subject could be created in which children teach the teacher.,
15271,"Naturally, of course, children and adolescents must be made aware of the dangers of social media, because bullying on social media is often seen as completely normal,” says Bleicher.",
15272,Bleicher sees another challenge ahead: “AI will play a big role in the future.,
15273,This will only intensify the challenges of trying to separate fact from fiction.,
15274,We already have a long tradition of fake news on the internet.,
15275,"With AI phenomena such as ChatGPT, however, it will reach a completely different level.
",
15276,"In December 2022, Universität Hamburg appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Laura Marie Edinger-Schons.",
15277,"Together with Hauke Heekeren, she speaks about the new role, the first measures to be implemented, and the key challenges.",
15278,"Heekeren: Humanity is facing existential challenges: climate change, species extinction, resource scarcity, just to name a few.",
15279,"As a University, we want to and must face these challenges at every level, in terms of research, teaching, and administration.",
15280,"I am convinced that we have a duty to contribute to finding solutions, and that as a University as a whole.",
15281,Edinger-Schons: I started very early as a researcher looking into matters of corporate responsibility.,
15282,"What really opened my eyes was a research stay in south-east Asia, where I was confronted with the immediate effects of changes to the ecosystem on people, for example the deforestation of rainforests, or plastic waste in the ocean.",
15283,A visit to sulfur mine in east Java really left a lasting impression on me.,
15284,Visitors were recommended to restrict their time there to less than 15 minutes.,
15285,"But there are people working there every day, performing the heaviest of physical labor, without any protection in the most toxic fumes.",
15286,"I started researching, to find out who were companies obtaining their raw materials here, and thus participating in the exploitation of people and the environment?",
15287,And how can companies be made to take on more responsibility for it?,
15288,These questions have not left me.,
15289,Heekeren:,
15290,We have a leading role and see ourselves as a flagship university that is working to make meaningful contributions across many fields.,
15291,"For example, the broad range of subjects and the courses we offer with a focus on sustainability show clearly that we are intensely involved in sustainability, both professionally and privately.",
15292,"We also provide the results of our research, as well as the expertise of our researchers, to the community and the political realm.",
15293,Of course we hope to find a receptive audience.,
15294,"As a University, we will also take steps to move forward sustainably, and we have ambitious goals.",
15295,That is why I am very happy that we have appointed a recognized expert in Ms. Edinger-Schons.,
15296,"Edinger-Schons: I would first like to get know the University, and collect the information I need to develop an evidence-based strategy.",
15297,"We will then analyze what are the most effective measures, and how we can best position ourselves?",
15298,The integration of digitalization and sustainability is really important.,
15299,That means it is clear we need a digital University in order to become sustainable.,
15300,"It will be based on an emissions balance sheet, but will extend far beyond climate matters.",
15301,"Through our research, our teaching, and our knowledge exchange, we can have very positive impact on sustainable development.",
15302,"In general, we want to reduce the negative impact of our presence, and maximize the positive impact of our activities.",
15303,Heekeren:,
15304,We are looking for synergies across the University.,
15305,"I have spent the past few months meeting people, an experience which has showed me we have a lot of engaged people with lots of great ideas.",
15306,We want to support those involved in sustainability issues.,
15307,"And we want to take this energy, and this inspiration, and use them to tackle constructive challenges.",
15308,"As a specific example, there was a suggestion to get the University certified as being bicycle-friendly, to provide more bicycle paths and bicycle parking.",
15309,"This is great, and we’re working towards it!",
15310,"Edinger-Schons: There will be “quick win” projects, that is, changes that can be quickly implemented that will bring us ahead in terms of sustainability.",
15311,And there will be projects that are more long-term.,
15312,"We want to move soon into knowledge exchange, and of course also into action, for example, with research groups for anyone who is interested and wanting to be involved in specific projects.",
15313,There should also be regular open sustainability plenums for anyone who wants to find out more about the current state of affairs.,
15314,"In general, it is important for me that the topic of sustainability is one filled with positive energy, because sustainability often carries negative associations, like restrictions or doing without, but we can also act to make positive changes.",
15315,Heekeren:,
15316,"First, we have to see what we already have.",
15317,"In recent years, a lot of preparatory work has been done, for example, through the Center for a Sustainable University, through the climate working group, and the sustainability in research working group.",
15318,The climate protection manager has also made some very important contributions.,
15319,"Now we are in the process of weaving these strands together, to coordinate them, make them visible, and then of course, to turn that into further action!",
15320,"We also have a lot of fields, like the Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS), and the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability, that are important partners in research and teaching for the CSO and the Sustainability Office.",
15321,Here we are keeping with the tradition of our Nobel Prize laureate Prof. Klaus Hasselmann and his pioneering research on climate change.,
15322,"Edinger-Schons: We are thinking to locate our office, at least in part, on the campus to make it visible, and to provide innovative and of course the most sustainable space possible for workshops, exhibits, and working spaces for the team.",
15323,We are considering a kind of climate neutral “Sustainability Village.”,
15324,"I am looking forward to the new tasks and the constructive collaboration with all the disciplines in the University, and I really hope we can achieve a good exchange of ideas and knowledge with a lot of innovative projects.",
15325,"Edinger-Schons: The climate working group has already started to put together a greenhouse gas emissions inventory considering all three scopes of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (direct, indirect, and value-chain).",
15326,This will be the starting point for our efforts to build a solid information base that will allow us to identify our emissions hot-spots and prioritize measures for action.,
15327,The collection of data is often one of action and reflection.,
15328,"To make sure that the information is as well presented and integrated as possible, we often need to use new, digital processes.",
15329,"All members of the University will then be involved in the implementation of these measures, we can only do it if we work together.",
15330,And I am really looking forward to it!,
15331,Heekeren:,
15332,The goal is to put Universität Hamburg on the best possible footing to achieve climate neutrality.,
15333,"This is how we will find and forge new paths into the future for the whole of the University.
",
15334,"This year, Universität Hamburg is funding 13 research projects in the amount of €341,000.",
15335,"Here, we introduce 2 of those projects.",
15336,"To date, the City of Hamburg has created 14 continuous bike lanes.",
15337,"These are designed to make it easier for Hamburg’s residents to cycle around the city, both for their own health and for the sake of the environment.",
15338,Are the bike lanes really user-friendly?,
15339,And do they really lead to more people using bicycles?,
15340,"“There are different types of mobility,” explains the geographer Dr. Thomas Pohl.",
15341,“Reaching a destination quickly is not the main reason for most people.,
15342,"For many, safety issues when cycling are crucial, but for some it could also be love of nature or other criteria.",
15343,"Due to these different needs, different groups perceive the new lanes differently.”",
15344,"Pohl and his team want to cycle the City’s lanes and document their properties, including ground surface and topography, lighting, lane width, and whether the lanes are separated spatially from other traffic.",
15345,"Additionally, they will ask cyclists how they assess and use the lanes.",
15346,"The findings should help planners better plan clients’ needs, and not only in Hamburg.",
15347,"“After all, throughout Germany, a lot is being invested into bicycle-friendly infrastructure, but so far there have been few empirical data,” says Pohl.",
15348,Pohl would also like to make the information about the bike lanes available on the Internet.,
15349,"This way, cyclists can better adapt their routes to their needs.",
15350,"Students want to use the outdoor spaces at Universität Hamburg more intensively—to meet, share, hang out, or study.",
15351,This was the conclusion of a survey as part of the BEAT! project on promoting and implementing student health management.,
15352,Sports scientist Laura Wagenhausen now wants to develop outdoor furniture to meet these needs and entice people to get moving.,
15353,"“After all, we all sit too much in our daily lives, with worrisome consequences for our health,” she explains.",
15354,"For the University, she envisions long-lasting furniture, for example, with handles for gymnastics or calisthenics; or thumbnail drive connections for charging mobile phones or laptops.",
15355,"Students from a cooperating university—for example, one that offers architecture studies—should design the furniture, with local craftspeople then building it.",
15356,"“The first pieces of furniture could already be set up on campus by next summer,” says Wagenhausen.",
15357,“We also hope that residents or University guests will use the furniture.,
15358,Then the outdoor areas at the University will be livelier than they are now.”,
15359,"It’s also conceivable, says Wagenhausen, to produce the furniture in series so that it has recognition value at various locations throughout Universität Hamburg.
",
15360,"To treat many diseases, it is vital to understand the exact nature of immune cells.",
15361,A research team headed by Prof. Dr. Florian Grüner at Universität Hamburg has now developed an innovative imaging method that enables direct examination of these cells.,
15362,"On 27 March, the results from the cooperation with the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were presented at Science City Bahrenfeld.",
15363,"For the first time, the newly developed method of measurement can gather data that had thus far remained unavailable for diagnostic purposes.",
15364,"Now, using X-Ray sources, the distribution of immune cells (among other things) towards immune responses can be be studied, thereby also contributing to the clarification of the causes of chronic inflammatory diseases.",
15365,"The findings could significantly facilitate the development of new treatments and the optimization of well-established treatments, also and especially for cancer.",
15366,"The use of the new imaging procedure is very promising, as well, for the tracking of nanoparticles, first deployed for the Covid vaccine, but which are also highly relevant in cancer treatment.",
15367,"This is why, among other reasons, the researchers are aiming to patent the procedure.",
15368,"Another important factor: the method has thus far been used only at large particle accelerators, like the electron-synchrotron at DESY.",
15369,"With the innovative development of a new kind of laboratory system, the procedure can be used with little difficulty in the future, also making it especially suitable for use in the Global South.",
15370,"To this end, cooperation with partners in science and industry is currently being forged.",
15371,"In the research project, the team headed by Prof. Dr. Florian Grüner, professor of accelerator physics in the Department of Physics at Universität Hamburg, is working closely with colleagues from the UKE.",
15372,"The program Calls for Transfer, run by Hamburg’s science office, contributed €30,000 towards the essential strategy whereby basic research is transferred directly to society at large.",
15373,This was already the second time Prof. Grüner has received this kind of funding.,
15374,The physicist explained: “Innovation is based very strongly on simply being able to test completely new ideas.,
15375,"But normally, you need to have already done initial work that you can point to for grant applications.",
15376,"And if you have a completely new, potentially innovative idea that you want to test, that’s a problem.",
15377,The Calls for Transfer funding has now made this possible.”,
15378,"Now, he continued, they can build upon their first testing successes.",
15379,The Calls for Transfer funding program financed by Hamburg’s science office and run by the Hamburg University of Technology has been strengthening ideas relevant to knowledge exchange and research-based and economically promising concepts since 2018.,
15380,"The format lends support for the development of innovative projects at all of Hamburg’s public universities, smoothing the way towards practical application for creative solutions from all subject areas.",
15381,"So far, 118 projects have received €30,000 each for their start and further development.

15382,The Liberal Arts and Sciences team is offering a course on political epistemology in connection with water management.,
15383,"The course will focus on Venice, among other things.",
15384,Photo: Toshihito Schemmel Prof. Dr. Matthias Schemmel took up his professorship for historical epistemology at Universität Hamburg at the beginning of 2022.,
15385,"He studied physics, astronomy, and mathematics at Universität Hamburg and history at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where he received his doctorate on early modern mechanical sci As part of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments, Universität Hamburg is developing a degree program in the liberal arts and sciences.",
15386,"The program is set to begin in Winter Semester 2023/2024 but there are already some exciting opportunities, including ones open to the general public.",
15387,"This format grew out of a research project that I am working on with international colleagues, for example, from Venice and India.",
15388,We are looking at different societies at different times and how they organized water management.  ,
15389,"We ask, for example, which experts are listened to and how decisions are made to deal with challenges such as changing tides, dangerous flooding, or the salination of freshwater.  ",
15390,"Against the backdrop of climate change and especially in northern Germany, these are acute issues.",
15391,And we hope that a look at the past will provide some inspiration now.,
15392,We would like to go deeper into these ideas and the fundamental concern with the relationship between science and society in our public lectures at the end of November and beginning of December and in our student workshops.,
15393,"It looks at current topics in their historical dimensions, at the junction of science and scholarship, culture, and society.",
15394,It is premised on the ideal of comprehensive education as Wilhelm von Humboldt conceived it roughly 200 years ago.,
15395,"But the tradition of the degree program goes back much further: it goes back to the ancients, who invented the liberal arts and sciences.",
15396,"At medieval universities, the study of the liberal arts prepared students for the study of theology or medicine.",
15397,"In modern times, the idea of the liberal arts and sciences has been realized primarily in the United States and, more recently, with increasing frequency in England, the Netherlands, and now again in Germany.",
15398,The courses will take place within the framework of the Studium Generale.,
15399,"Thus, they will be open to all students.",
15400,You could say they are a kind of test-run for the Liberal Arts and Sciences program.,
15401,A lot!,
15402,"Of course, a lot of administration: We have to develop curricula and module descriptions, which committees provide expert evaluations and authorization.",
15403,And then there is the content.,
15404,There are 2 professorships for the program and we need to organize cooperation with the colleagues in various departments and faculties—the program is highly interdisciplinary.,
15405,"There is a lot of interest and we are now clarifying the details. 
",
15406,"The main focus of a visit to Universität Hamburg by a delegation from Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia) was support for doctoral and early career researchers.",
15407,"Among other things, the universities’ presidents extended a university-wide agreement for a master’s student exchange.",
15408,"At first, the delegation accompanying vice chancellor Prof. S. Bruce Dowton visited the dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences.",
15409,"In his conversation with the dean, Prof. Dr. Norbert Ritter, and vice dean, Prof. Dr. Kai Jensen, they discussed deeper cooperation between the departments involved when it comes to support for doctoral and early career researchers.",
15410,"Afterwards, the University’s president, Prof.Dr. Hauke Heekeren, greeted the delegation.",
15411,"The leadership of both universities especially emphasized their very close and trusting cooperation at all levels of their institutions, from students, doctoral and early career researchers, and administrative staff to researchers.",
15412,Both universities have signed several agreements and contracts to formalize their cooperation.,
15413,"At the end of the visit, Bruce Dowton and Hauke Heekeren signed an extension of the University-wide agreement for master’s student exchange.",
15414,The strategic partnership between Universität Hamburg and Macquarie University has been in place since 2012.,
15415,There are funding opportunities for various status groups at Universität Hamburg through the Department of International Affairs.,
15416,There will also be common events and activities.,
15417,"Both universities, alongside Fudan University from 2015 to 2021, were part of the DAAD-funded trilateral network MQ-FU-HAM that is now being funded autonomously by the participating universities.
",
15418,The population benefits little from Madagascar’s unique species diversity.,
15419,The majority of the almost 28 million inhabitants lives in poverty and depends on the exploitation of natural resources.,
15420,"Due to its isolation from the mainland, the island has species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world: over 90 percent of the fauna and 80 percent of the flora are endemic.",
15421,"The greatest threats to the country’s biodiversity are deforestation, poaching, and climate change.",
15422,Crises such as the corona pandemic exacerbate the stress on species diversity.,
15423,"The funding measure Hamburglobal PhD, which taps resources from the Excellence Strategy, enables doctoral researchers at Universität Hamburg to study abroad for several months.",
15424,The geographer Leo van Versendaal is studying the impact of the corona pandemic on Madascar’s unique biodiversity.,
15425,Madagascar is one of the world’s oldest islands.,
15426,"It is home to flora and fauna that you find nowhere else—for example, primate groups such as lemurs, or the traveler’s tree, which looks like a palm tree.",
15427,Clearing and poaching have long threatened the island’s unique biodiversity.,
15428,"Currently, for example, far more than 100 mammal species are facing extinction.",
15429,"When the corona pandemic began, I was afraid that the pressure on biodiversity would increase even more—due, for example, to increasing poverty among the population and the exploitation of natural resources.",
15430,I wanted to find out if that was true; also so that I could analyze how we can better shape conservation for the future.,
15431,"I traveled through Madagascar with a translator for 3 months, interviewed nature protection organizations, and initiated focus group discussions with the local population.",
15432,I am now comparing the organizations with regard to their nature protection plans to find out which are the most efficient and may prove effective in future crises.,
15433,"In doing so, it’s important to incorporate the ideas and needs of the local resident population.",
15434,"The population of Madagascar is, on the whole, very poor and depends on natural resources such as wood.",
15435,Their poverty became more pressing thanks to the reduction in tourism during the pandemic.,
15436,This state of emergency also led to greater pressure on the natural world.,
15437,"Additionally, nature protection organizations received fewer or late donations and, due to the lockdown, could not enter their project areas.",
15438,"As a result, there were fewer ranger patrols, the country’s national parks were unprotected, and there were more illegal and unsustainable activities such as deforesting and hunting.",
15439,This increased burden on natural resources created a significant danger to Madagascar’s biodiversity.,
15440,My impression is that those project are successful in which local communities take care of natural protection themselves—so-called “community-based conservation projects.”,
15441,"In these cases, people have a comprehensive understanding of what nature protection actually is.",
15442,"When it comes to crisis management, however, it’s tricky: negotiations often start only when it is already too late.",
15443,"But I hope that the conversations I initiated might already lead to the first step towards change.
",
15444,"In the fourth episode of Universität Hamburg’s Research for Everyone series, Yvan Chevchuk and Kyle Ann Huskin from the Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts talk about the techniques they use to reconstruct lost or erased writing in manuscripts and written works.",
15445,The main technology used to recover old texts is called “multispectral imaging.”,
15446,This technology involves taking numerous photographs at various light wavelengths in a dark room.,
15447,Researchers create a spectral dataset in a video.,
15448,The data are then evaluated using a computer.,
15449,The textual sources studied using this technology range from Plato’s early works to payment logs from World War II.,
15450,"In the Understanding Written Artefacts cluster of excellence, researchers study the development and purposes of written artefacts in manuscript cultures, from their beginnings in ancient Mesopotamia to the digital age.",
15451,"The starting point is always the organic or inorganic artefact, which consists of hard or flexible material, and both the writing and traces of production, use, and in some cases adapted use.

15455,"The high-performance supercomputer MISTRAL supports high-resolution climate simulations, helping reduce the uncertainties in climate projections.",
15456,"At the end of his visit to the Cluster of Excellence CLICCS, Heiko Maas answered questions from members of the press.",
15457,"In front of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ), from left to right: CLICCS Speaker Prof. Detlef Stammer; Prof. Amrita Narlikar, President of the German Institute of Global and Area Studies; CLICCS Co-Speaker Dr. Jochem Marotzke; Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas; Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office Niels Annen; doctoral candidate Anusha Sunkisala; Director of the German Climate Computing Center Prof.",
15458,"Thomas Ludwig; doctoral candidate Gibran Romero Mujalli, and doctoral candidate Maike Scheffold.",
15459,"Expertise like that produced at Universität Hamburg’s Cluster of Excellence “Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS)” is essential in order to convince skeptics at the international political level of the reality of climate change, underscored Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas during his visit.",
15460,"Prior to a meeting with ministers from the Baltic States in Hamburg, Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas found time to meet with climate researchers from Universität Hamburg and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.",
15461,"In the course of a round table discussion, leading experts on international climate research brought him up to speed on how their cluster works: with regard to the current state of research, he spoke with CLICCS Speaker Prof. Detlef Stammer, Director of Universität Hamburg’s Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) and Chair of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP); and with CLICCS Co-Speaker Prof. Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and one of the twelve lead authors of the latest Assessment Report.",
15462,"Minister Maas also fielded questions posed by doctoral students from the graduate school SICSS (School of Integrated Climate System Sciences), affiliated with CLICCS, before touring the climate supercomputer MISTRAL at the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ).",
15463,"In service since 2015, MISTRAL supports high-resolution climate simulations, reducing the uncertainties in climate projections.",
15464,"As Heiko Maas said during his first address to the UN Security Council at the beginning of the year, climate change is one of the central issues that Germany wants to pursue at the UNSC.",
15465,"Yet the conditions for doing so on the international stage have since worsened, as Maas explained during his visit to Hamburg: due e.g. to the USA’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the generally complex and tense state of affairs around the globe, and a growing tendency to put stock in simple “truths” – or even in conspiracy theories.",
15466,"The latter aspect is one he can only counteract on the political stage if he knows the concrete impacts of climate change; for example, how it is destroying livelihoods in specific regions or leading to mass migrations.",
15467,"Investigating and forecasting the regional effects of climate change are among the most important goals of the Cluster of Excellence for climate research at Universität Hamburg, as CLICCS Speaker Prof. Detlef Stammer assured Minister Maas: CLICCS is exploring the scientific basis of climate change, as well as the interactions between the climate and societies, which react to climate changes and, in the process, affect the climate.",
15468,"According to Stammer, the overarching goal is to identify courses of action and adaptation scenarios for various cultures and corners of the globe.",
15469,"In turn, CLICCS Co-Speaker Jochem Marotzke explained that, despite advanced computational models, we would never have 100% reliable information on the future development of the climate: certain aspects of the climate system display chaotic behavior, which makes them unpredictable.",
15470,"When asked by the Minister if he, as a scientist, found this fact frustrating, Marotzke answered in the negative.",
15471,"As he explained, it is precisely by identifying these unavoidable uncertainties that those aspects that are undeniable become all the clearer: that human beings are partly to blame for climate change, and the consequences of our actions.",
15472,"Lastly, Prof. Amrita Narlikar, President of the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA), stressed the importance of researchers sharing their knowledge in a way the public can understand.",
15473,"“It’s not enough to keep saying that it’s complicated,” said the Professor of Political Science and International Relations.
",
15474,The newly created program for postdoctoral fellowships within the context of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments supports researchers who did their doctorates at Universität Hamburg and are working in one of the University’s emerging fields.,
15475,The first fellows have now been announced.,
15476,Philosopher Dr. Jakob Koscholke and literary scholar Dr. Rogier Gerrits are the first postdoctoral researchers to receive research project funding from Universität Hamburg’s postdoctoral fellowship program.,
15477,"They will receive a substantial budget for materials: €20,000 annually for a 3-year period.",
15478,"Rogier Gerrits: Among other things, I will take archival trips.",
15479,"I am researching the representation of miracles in the Early Modern World in France and want to find out how miracles in this period were captured in paintings or in poems, sermons, or eyewitness accounts.",
15480,"I hope to find contemporary written artifacts in the major libraries—for example, in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.",
15481,"But I would also like to look for traces of miracles in the provinces and, if possible, discover as-yet-unknown sources.",
15482,Jakob Koscholke: I will travel to conferences and also invite others to conferences.,
15483,"At the European level, there is currently no network for exchange on my research topic—that is, the value of knowledge for the individual and for society.",
15484,"So far, philosophers concerned with these issues have often shared thoughts by publishing their work.",
15485,I find that unsatisfying.,
15486,Jakob Koscholke: I am concerned with the value of knowledge.,
15487,This has been one of the fundamental questions in epistemology since antiquity.,
15488,It goes back even as far as Plato.,
15489,"Today, sociopolitical developments seem to question this value: we are living in a so-called postfactual era.",
15490,"In my view, this means that it is imperative to draw a line between knowledge and mere opinion.",
15491,"Rogier Gerrits: I would like to find out how a miracle, meaning a natural but rather incredible event, can be represented plausibly.",
15492,"This is, of course, a paradox that I would like to study more closely on the basis of literary analysis and an interdisciplinary approach.",
15493,Jakob Koscholke:,
15494,I think it is exciting the way,
15495,philosophers today focus on the value of knowledge.,
15496,"In addition to philosophy, I studied logic, which is why it makes me curious to work in my area using the methods of probability calculations or game theory.",
15497,Rogier Gerrits:,
15498,Miracles have always fascinated people.,
15499,They inspire a thirst for knowledge.,
15500,The belief in miracles still plays a role in the Catholic Church today.,
15501,"As I look more closely at miracles and their representation in the Early Modern World, I am interested in the way this fascination can become manifest in art.",
15502,"Rogier Gerrits: No, I am far too matter-of-fact for that.",
15503,The funding period for the third postdoctoral researchers set to begin in 2020 will also begin in August.,
15504,"Dr. Doru Constantin Doroftei is a philosopher, linguist, and Jewish studies scholar.
",
15505,"In his opening speech, University president Prof. Dr. Hauke Heekeren thanked the researchers who worked to present the latest research in an interactive exhibit that is easy to understand.",
15506,"Prof. Dr. Erika Garutti, spokesperson of the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe, led the guests through the opening of the the exhibit.",
15507,The big bang occurred about 14 billion years ago.,
15508,"At the time, the universe was still dark.",
15509,"It was not until 380,000 years later that the universe became visible.",
15510,This change is symbolized by a colored curtain in the “How it all began” exhibit.,
15511,The exhibit also presents work by 5 northern German artists who focus on the big bang and the universe.,
15512,The multi-media special exhibition “How it all began” opened in the Museum of Work at an event attended by about 200 guests.,
15513,"Until 10 April 2023, this extraordinary collaborative project between the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe, DESY, and the Museum of Work takes visitors to the museum on a journey from the Big Bang through to the endlessness of space.",
15514,"A spark chamber, that reveals the omnipresent radiation of space.",
15515,A corner where two players can kick protons into mighty collisions.,
15516,And black and white sandhills that represent the matter and antimatter of space after the big bang.,
15517,A single grain of sand on the white pile symbolized the tiny bit of matter responsible for the whole of the universe.,
15518,"Because without this tiny little bit left over, matter and antimatter would have canceled each other out.",
15519,We still don’t know why this didn’t happen.,
15520,"“The questions that are still unanswered about the beginning of the universe are humbling,” revealed University president Prof. Dr. Hauke Heekeren in his opening speech.",
15521,"As a neuroscientist, he is used to complex and abstract problems, but picturing what happened in the immediate aftermath of the big bang is a challenge for anyone’s imagination.",
15522,Which made Prof. Heekeren all the more grateful to the researchers who worked on the project to present the latest research in an interactive exhibit which is easy to understand.,
15523,"“This kind of knowledge transfer is one of the key functions of Universität Hamburg and its four clusters of excellence, and it is also particularly important to me personally,” he emphasized.",
15524,"And in fact, part of the exhibit does demonstrate the every day work undertaken by researchers at Universität Hamburg and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY).",
15525,"Astrophysicists, experimental physicists, and mathematicians present video reports of their exciting discoveries in the lab, and also the everyday activities that flow around telephone calls and meetings.",
15526,"Large-format images show the technology that is helping them explain the secrets of the universe, for example the particle accelerator at CERN.",
15527,This is also a clear demonstration of the role that Hamburg plays in the global search for new particles and knowledge about the origins of the universe.,
15528,"“The Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe at Universität Hamburg, in collaboration with DESY is part of the exceptional research alliances working in this field,” explains Prof. Heekeren.",
15529,"“There are 300 researchers working there, who are among the best specialists in the world.”",
15530,Getting to know these researchers and their work is a central part of the design of the exhibit.,
15531,"The guests invited to the opening event were led through the exhibit by spokesperson for the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe, Prof. Dr. Erika Garutti.",
15532,There are many events planned with her colleagues from Quantum Universe for the coming winter.,
15533,"Starting off, astrophysicist Prof. Dr. Jochen Liske from the Hamburg Observatory is presenting a lecture on 7 November, “Am Anfang war das Licht” (in the beginning there was light).",
15534,This will be followed on 14 November with a discussion with DESY particle physicist Prof. Dr. Georg Weinglein on the Higgs boson particle.,
15535,"Some of the upcoming events are designed for children and adolescents.
",
15536,We already know where the fin whales of the southern hemisphere feed.,
15537,"Researchers, however, have not yet studied where they mate and breed.",
15538,"Now an expedition to the Antarctic, which started on 25 February, hopes to find out.",
15539,The Universität Hamburg biologist Dr. Helena Herr is leading the expedition.,
15540,"In this interview, she talks about the project and the special challenges it poses.",
15541,"This time, it’s the whole gamut: we have drones and cameras to estimate the number of fin whales in our study area and to study their movement patterns.",
15542,We want to use an acoustic recorder to record the whale vocalizations.,
15543,"At the same time, we will conduct a krill survey, during which we will sample krill biomass and distribution along our cruise track to analyze the relationship between the distribution of krill and whales.",
15544,"The special thing is that for the first time, we will equip the fin whales with satellite transmitters.",
15545,"Ideally, these will transmit the whales position for up to one-and-half years, everytime the whales surfaces, which will enable us to track their migration .",
15546,"Like most baleen whales, fin whales migrate seasonally, which means that in the Austral summer, they head to the well-known feeding grounds and afterwards move on to other areas where they mate and breed.",
15547,"But where these regions are, we don’t know, and this is what we want to find that out using these transmitters.",
15548,", We know the whales’ feeding grounds and we will systematically cover these by our visual survey.",
15549,"When we find a larger number of fin whales, we will launch small boats to approach the whales.",
15550,The transmitters will be deployed using a kind of air gun.,
15551,"We will try to deploy them directly below the dorsal fin, because the transmitters transmit the position via satellite and they can do so only if the antennae break through the water’s surface.",
15552,That’s why the transmitters have to be placed at the highest point of the whale that regularly surfaces.,
15553,We will choose healthy animals for the transmitters.,
15554,"We cannot say that the whales don’t notice anything; after all, we find shots unpleasant as well.",
15555,"Sometimes the animals react by diving, but often they don’t react at all.",
15556,"While it may sound brutal, we have to put this in proportion, because the transmitters help us study and protect whale populations.",
15557,And the transmitter that we use is 30 centimeters in length while the whale’s blubber is up to 50 centimeters thick.,
15558,"Over time, the transmitter, like a splinter, may grow out.",
15559,"And even if it doesn’t, it is constructed so as not to harm the whale.",
15560,It is basically like an implant.,
15561,"As a rule, we would also not choose young animals or animals that are clearly unwell or weak for the transmitters.",
15562,And whale calves are absolutely off limits.,
15563,"We will choose the healthiest, hardiest animals possible for the transmitters.",
15564,Twenty-five in total.,
15565,We have 19 transmitters that are larger and should last over a year.,
15566,"Then there are 6 smaller ones that last a shorter time but can transmit more than just position; they can also transmit, among other things, diving depth and the time a whale spends at certain depths.",
15567,"Of those, we recently placed 2 as a pilot study during another expedition.",
15568,These 2 transmitters lasted 30 days and we captured the tracks of 2 fin whales during that time.,
15569,"When they left the feeding grounds, they swam an almost parallel course and apparently had the same destination.",
15570,"However, we don’t know the ultimate destination because the transmitters didn’t last long enough.",
15571,"To be able to find out whether swimming in the same direction was coincidental or if the whales from different feeding grounds were really headed to the same destination, we need a larger sample and longer transmission times.",
15572,So we will not use all the transmitters at once; just a few at each station we are heading to.,
15573,The whales’ positions will be received via the Argos satellite system and made available on a user platform where they can be accessed.,
15574,You can even adjust it so that the program informs you every time a new whale position is available.,
15575,"For the first 2 transmitters that we deployed, I followed every push message nervously to check the transmission of every data point.",
15576,We assume that the whales will stay at the feeding grounds until the end of the feeding season and will start their migration before Antarctic winter sets in in May.,
15577,Both whales from the pilot study started off on exactly the same day.,
15578,"Tracking their migration, we will observe where the animals stop their transit and come to rest again—that will be their wintering ground and probably also their mating area.",
15579,"In a year, we expect them again in the western Antarctic for feeding.",
15580,So we don’t have to wait until the transmitters stop transmitting; hopefully we will already have some important findings in half a year.,
15581,No.,
15582,"We will also obtain a small tissue sample from every whale equipped with a transmitter so that we can determine the sex, genetically identify the whale, and, via the analysis of stable isotopes and fatty acids, gain information about feeding ecology.",
15583,So we are trying to better characterize the tagged whales and to obtain information about population structures.,
15584,A lot of our knowledge still is from the whaling period.,
15585,There are many reasons.,
15586,"Much of our knowledge on fin whales is from the whaling period, which means that we know where their feeding grounds are located because this is where they were caught.",
15587,"Due to intensive whaling in the twentieth century, however, fin whale populations especially became so decimated that when whaling ended there were hardly any left to study.",
15588,"Then there is the fact that the fin whale is harder to study, say, than the humpback whale because the fin whales do not gather at coastal breeding grounds; they live far from the coasts and can be observed in larger groups only in the Antarctic.",
15589,"Having recently been able to prove scientifically that the population is recovering was a huge step, and increased numbers now make other projects possible.",
15590,"However, all Antarctic research is labor-intensive and expensive.",
15591,You first have to have the resources.,
15592,It is a huge privilege to be able to use a German research vessel solely for the purpose of fin whale research.,
15593,"Our trip will take place under the aegis of Universität Hamburg with logistical and staffing support from the Alfred Wegener Institute and the participation of researchers from, among other places, the University of Gdansk, the Italian Tethys Research Institute, and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.",
15594,"For the ship time application, we already had to provide a very detailed description of what we want to study and how it can be best achieved.",
15595,"Of course, we also had to fill the 21 berths available for researcher on board, with experts in the respective fields, as well as technicians and students.",
15596,The person deploying the transmitters is of speial importance.,
15597,There are only a handful of people in the world who have the necessary expertise and experience.,
15598,"My colleague from the University of Washington who is joining the expedition has already placed transmitters on many species of whales in the most diverse ocean waters, so she is our guarantee that everything will be handled optimally.",
15599,A camera!,
15600,"We are traveling to such a fascinating, impressive, and unknown world in which we will no doubt encounter so many things that we will definitely want to photograph.",
15601,"Other than that, for the atmosphere on board to be good it helps a lot when the food is good.",
15602,We also have a medical doctor on board because evacuation in case of need is very difficult in the Antarctic.,
15603,"Other than that, it helps to have an emotional armor consisting of sound preparation, a certain level of trust, and patience.",
15604,Because we don’t know what the weather will be like when we arrive.,
15605,It may be that we will have to endure 2 weeks of stormy weather or fog and cannot lower the small boats into the water.,
15606,"On my last expedition, we encountered the first fin whale aggregation 6 weeks into the cruise only.",
15607,"So you need to be somewhat relaxed for this kind of venture and you cannot succumb right away to despair if it doesn’t all go according to plan.

15608,"Prof. Stacey Lee’s areas of specialty are law, ethics, and the health system.",
15609,"Ms. Lee teaches and researches at the crossroads of these fields at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.",
15610,"During her 2-week visit at Universität Hamburg, Lee explored new possibilities for cooperation between the partner universities.",
15611,"The Carey Business School is part of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.",
15612,"Hopkins was founded in 1876 and modeled upon the German university, making it the first university to combine research and teaching.",
15613,"Today, the private institution is one of America’s elite universities.",
15614,The business school was founded in 2007.,
15615,"Roughly 1,000 full-time and 1,300 part-time students from 60 countries are now working towards a degree: either the Master of Business Administration or a Master of Science.",
15616,I am visiting Universität Hamburg as part of a Fulbright program funded by the US Department of State and the German government.,
15617,This enables academics from the United States to visit Germany.,
15618,"My stay was primarily intended to strengthen ties between Universität Hamburg and the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, particularly in the field of health economics.",
15619,"For example, Prof. Dr. Jonas Schreyögg, the director of the Hamburg Center for Health Economics (HCHE) and I have developed a plan for a joint research workshop.",
15620,This workshop could already take place in Hamburg next year and then continue in Baltimore the following year.,
15621,"As a child, I lived for 3 years in Germany; my father was stationed here.",
15622,This made my return especially exciting.,
15623,"After my studies, I worked as a lawyer for more than 10 years.",
15624,I’ve worked for some of the largest healthcare corporations in the US.,
15625,"My focus was on advancing the companies interests, which did not always align with the patients.",
15626,"After several years, I felt the need to change to a more holistic approach to the law.",
15627,"As a scientist, I can deal with the question of what legislation should look like in an ideal world.",
15628,"For example, I investigate whether a citizen of the United States has the right to get a particular medicine.",
15629,This question becomes important when a person is terminally ill but a potentially effective drug has not yet been approved.,
15630,Pharmaceutical companies make no exception in such cases; they are not allowed to release a drug if it is still in the approval phase.,
15631,I believe that this is wrong and incompatible with American law.,
15632,Great beer and great food!,
15633,(Laughs),
15634,"Mostly, however, that the law requires you to retire at a certain age and the state pension system.",
15635,"We dont have either one of these in America., About the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School 
",
15636,"For the second time, Universität Hamburg is funding student research projects as part of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.",
15637,"Starting immediately, 9 projects will receive support for one year.",
15638,"The University is granting about €60,000.",
15639,Below we introduce 3 of the projects.,
15640,"In the Bergedorf district of Hamburg, a previously buried treasure awaits musicologists: the estate of Friedrich Chrysander, born in 1826.",
15641,"Chrsyander ran a sheet-music printing shop there and published music journals as well as, among other things, the works of Georg Friedrich Händel.",
15642,He was indispensable to the music world and musicological discourse of the nineteenth century.,
15643,"His estate includes copies of sheet music and roughly 400 letters, for example from the Hamburg composer Johannes Brahms.",
15644,"As part of their research project, Johannes Schröder and Johanna Backhaus from the Institute of Historical Musicology at Universität Hamburg want to digitalize the documents in the family’s estate and ensure proper storage.",
15645,"In a second phase, they want to study the handwritten material and then, in a third phase, organize a workshop for students to which they would also invite external researchers.",
15646,"Against the backdrop of a global climate crisis and 3,000 deaths in traffic accidents annually in Germany, the centrality of the car in the transport system is increasingly coming under fire.",
15647,"The demands for a change in mobility are growing louder and in many places, alternative mobility concepts are being explored.",
15648,"Implementing these, however, is a frequently arduous, conflict-ridden matter.",
15649,Sociology students Eva Gaßen and Corinna Endreß want to find out why.,
15650,"They will categorize and compare roughly 10 Hamburg initiatives, for example the Ottensen macht Platz (“Ottensen makes room”) initiative.",
15651,Who is involved and why?,
15652,What conflicts arise and who gets involved in these?,
15653,And do these conflicts ultimately lead to more environmentally-friendly mobility or to deeper divisions?,
15654,"The upcoming researchers will seek answers to these questions using, among other tools, guideline-based digital interviews.",
15655,Biofuel plays an important role in the economy’s shift to regenerative energy.,
15656,Yet the cultivation of energy-producing plants such as rapeseed or corn requires space—space that is also needed for food and feed plants.,
15657,"This has inspired 20 students in various degree programs in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences to research new types of biofuel production.",
15658,They want to experiment with cyanobacteria.,
15659,"These bacteria appear in water, extract CO2 from the atmosphere, and build biomass that can be converted into biofuel.",
15660,"So far, however, the yield has been minimal.",
15661,"Therefore, the students are conducting lab experiments in which they add enzymes that have not previously appeared in cyanobacteria.",
15662,"Their goal is to stimulate the bacteria to produce high-quality biomass, meaning biomass that contains more energy.",
15663,The students also want to develop creative techniques that teams working in biotechnology can use to develop their own ideas as well as forge new paths in PR.,
15664,"With their project, they are taking part in 2021 in the largest student research competition in the field of synthetic biology, the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM).
",
15665,"Courses on academic writing, student projects, and seminars on current issues: since the beginning of October, the newly founded Center for Interdisciplinary Studies and Academic Skills has offered a range of opportunities for students.",
15666,The center gives students a new interdisciplinary experience and an opportunity to look beyond the boundaries of their own subject area.,
15667,"All opportunities focus on the development of research-based, critical thinking skills, especially with regard to current issues.",
15668,“Interdisciplinary goals called for the founding of a cross-faculty center.,
15669,"It enjoyed strong support from the Executive University Board, especially from the vice president for studies and teaching, Prof. Dr. Susanne Rupp,” said Prof. Dr. Telse Iwers, the center’s academic director.",
15670,"Interdisciplinary courses form the center’s first pillar, the Studium Generale.",
15671,"Previously, these were offered by individual faculties and other institutions throughout the University and thus remained less visible to students who were not in the given faculties.",
15672,These opportunities are now consolidated in the Studium Generale and students in many degree programs or in professional certification programs can now choose them as free elective courses.,
15673,"With funding from the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments, there will soon be more courses.",
15674,"The Digital and Data LITERACY IN Teaching Lab (DDLitLab) project, funded via a foundation for innovation in university teaching, Stiftung Innovation Hochschullehre, forms the center’s second pillar and it focuses on developing courses that foster data management skills.",
15675,These courses will also be integrated into the Studium Generale.,
15676,The center’s third pillar fosters student research groups.,
15677,"Every year, funding is available for students who wish to conduct their own research in independent research groups.",
15678,"To integrate the various opportunities, Swantje Ziegert, the new center’s managing director, said: “We want to create a place for students where they can find interdisciplinary opportunities at the University under one roof.",
15679,Student research projects can be better supported here with workspace and the participation of contacts.”,
15680,"The Writing Center, the fourth pillar, offers students workshops and advice on academic writing while teachers can also receive support in designing lessons on academic writing.",
15681,"By December, almost 20 staff members will have set up office at Jungiusstraße 11, not far from Planten un Blomen.",
15682,Students can go there for individual advice.,
15683,"Beforehand, you can take a look at offers on the center’s website.

15684,"A number of great names in the field of art history have taught and worked at Universität Hamburg: Aby Warburg (1866–1929), Erwin Panofsky (1892–1968), and Martin Warnke (born 1937), to name a few.",
15685,"Warnke, emeritus professor at our University since 2003, turned 80 on 12 October and to mark this momentous event the Art History Seminar organized a special lecture on 16 October held by the distinguished Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg.",
15686,It all begins with Aby Warburg.,
15687,"The banker’s son inspired by art history laid the foundations for a new method in his doctoral dissertation: iconography, or rather iconology—deriving the meaning of an artwork’s symbolic form in its historical context.",
15688,"As a private scholar, Warburg built up an extensive and world-famous art history library in the Heilwigstrasse, in the building that today houses the Warburg-Haus and was back then the hub for an intellectual circle of great renown to which the philosopher Ernst Cassirer and the art historian Erwin Panofsky, both professors at Universität Hamburg, belonged.",
15689,"After the National Socialists seized power in 1933, staff moved the library to London—Warburg had already passed away in 1929.",
15690,The empty library building housed various businesses well into the 1990s.,
15691,"The rediscovery of the Warburg-Haus took place during Martin Warnke’s time as professor for art history at Universität Hamburg, an appointment he had held since 1978.",
15692,"Together with Warburg enthusiasts such as the senator for science and research Leonhard Hajen and various patrons of the arts, Warnke succeeded in breathing academic life into the building once more.",
15693,"In 1993 the city of Hamburg purchased the building and after restoration works, entrusted it in 1995 to the newly founded Aby Warburg Foundation.",
15694,Today the Warburg-Haus is a joint institution of Universtät Hamburg and the Foundation.,
15695,Martin Warnke was not only instrumental in establishing the Warburg-Haus as a research institution; he also revived Warburg’s methodological approaches.,
15696,"Thanks to the award of the Leibniz Prize of the German Research Foundation in 1991, he was able to establish the Research Centre for Political Iconography, which explores the artistic demonstration and communication of power and political control throughout history, in the Warburg-Haus.",
15697,"Today the Centre houses an image database with over 250,000 items cataloged according to more than 200 topics such as “terror,” “catastrophe,” or “anarchy.”",
15698,Warnke thus rehabilitated an art historical methodology that had been forced to emigrate from Germany under the National Socialists.,
15699,"“We thought that we had rediscovered Warburg for art history in Europe, however, the fact is that Warburg was always around in Italy,” Warnke recalls his work in the 1990s.",
15700,"As a student and during long research visits to Italy, Warburg had forged contact with many scholars.",
15701,This meant that it was no surprise that Italian scholars were amongst the early visitors to the Warburg-Haus.,
15702,"One of those was the historian Carlo Ginzburg, then already teaching art history at the University of California.",
15703,Ginzburg remained true to Hamburg and to Warburg: in 1992 he was awarded the Aby Warburg Prize from the City of Hamburg and in 1996 he held the Warburg Professorship at Universität Hamburg.,
15704,Ginzburg also sustained his friendship with Martin Warnke.,
15705,Hence it was a logical step to invite Carlo Ginzburg to hold the lecture to honor Martin Warnke.,
15706,"Ginzburg’s lecture on 16 October, entitled “Unintended Convergences: Ernesto di Martino and Aby Warburg,” illuminated a further facet of Warburg, namely the parallels between the well-known Italian ethnologist and anthropologist Ernesto de Martino and his ethnographic studies in southern Italy, in particular on religion and magic.
",
15707,Twenty Universität Hamburg researchers have been receiving money from the newly established Idea and Venture Fund as part of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.,
15708,The researchers should use the 1-year funding period to prepare a large externally funded project.,
15709,We are introducing 3 projects.,
15710,How we judge the development of the stock market or the course of an illness varies from person to person.,
15711,But why?,
15712,Are the assessments a consequence of someone’s prior knowledge and experience?,
15713,"Or is the way we evaluate risk innate—that is, do we have a genetic disposition?",
15714,"To find this out, Prof. Dr. Petra Steinorth will ask at least 500 to 1,000 test subjects to make predictions about financial time series based on given information.",
15715,"“I will investigate whether we can identify types whose predictions always reveal a certain pattern; that means—for example—their prognoses are often similar to ones they made before or do not sufficiently integrate new information,” says Steinorth.",
15716,"If it is possible to create a typology, the business economist would like to apply for a DFG grant and take a closer look at her test subjects’ genes in a follow-up project.",
15717,"“We’re still doing pure basic research; we just want to understand how people make decisions,” says Steinroth.",
15718,"Knowing which factors play a role in evaluating risk or making prognoses has consequences for many areas of our lives— for example, what kind of retirement plans people make or how a doctor predicts the course of an illness and treats it.",
15719,"In the Renaissance, between 1450 and 1600 CE, more was written about the Greek philosopher Aristotle than in all the previous centuries taken together—and this despite the fact that Aristotle, who was born in 384 BCE, significantly shaped ancient Christian, Jewish, and Arab thought.",
15720,The historian Dr. Michael Engel will be looking at this hitherto neglected phenomenon.,
15721,"“I would like to show how Aristotle’s popularity boomed shortly following the invention of printing—and perhaps find the first clues to the end of his towering status,” says Engel.",
15722,"For at the dawn of the modern era, researchers radically changed the way they think: while Aristotle had attempted to understand the essence of humanness or nature primarily through pure thought, scientists such as Copernicus and Galileo were now beginning to measure and conduct experiments to answer their questions.",
15723,Engel will look for original sources in Italian archives and make them and other well-known sources available in an online database.,
15724,The world’s population is growing rapidly and with it the need for food.,
15725,Yet climate change is making it hard in many places to cultivate food crops.,
15726,"For example, not all plants tolerate the increase in sunlight: intense light can destroy the parts of the cells required for photosynthesis and plant growth.",
15727,"As a result, plants produce less biomass and become less fruitful.",
15728,"“There are, however, proteins that can help cells adapt to increased sun radiation.",
15729,"One of these proteins is the little-studied SCO4 protein,” says biologist Dr. Monique Liebers.",
15730,"She wants to find out whether this protein can be used in the future to optimize useful plants in order to expand cultivation areas for important crops such as wheat, rice, and soy.",
15731,"To do so, she needs to find out where in the cell the protein is produced, what it does exactly, and with which other proteins in interacts.",
15732,This is a complex process: She needs to multiply the protein and create an antibody.,
15733,"Using the antibody, she can isolate the proteins that interact with SCOR in the sample thale cress plant.",
15734,Then she can identify and confirm these interacting agents using various methods of analysis.,
15735,"“I cannot yet determine how well my research on food plants can be transferred,” says Dr. Liebers.",
15736,"She is planning the transfer as the first part of a DFG project for which she will apply in 2021.
",
15737,"Starting in Winter Semester 2021/2022, the staff of the new Welcome Service will be helping international researchers organize their stay in Hamburg.",
15738,The Welcome Service is financed from the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments funding.,
15739,Service head Jan Kochanowsi introduces their offers.,
15740,My 3 colleagues and I will help international researchers get oriented in their new environment.,
15741,"There are many issues here, for example, questions about residence permits, health insurance, or the search for housing.",
15742,"Our advising services target international doctoral researchers, postdoctoral researchers, and visiting scholars.",
15743,"Newly appointed professors from abroad, however, will continue to be supported by the Service for Newly Appointed Professors and International Visiting Scholars.",
15744,"For example, families with children who have impairments or special needs are a challenge.",
15745,"To reach the goal together, we often need to think about social, cultural, and structural differences in a very special way.",
15746,"There is a lot we cannot solve ourselves, so we refer people to the right places and work with numerous municipal authorities and organizations.",
15747,"We help people help themselves, as it were.",
15748,We can’t provide concrete legal advice or actively search for and find housing for researchers.,
15749,"We do give pointers, however, that increase the chances of success.",
15750,"With this new service, we are pursuing one of our central goals in our Excellence grant application: to make Hamburg more attractive for top researchers from all over the world.",
15751,"Within the University, the Welcome Service has been warmly received.",
15752,"Previously, international researchers had to get support directly from the faculties or other University bodies.",
15753,"Now we can relieve them of these duties.

15754,Dr. Danilo Harms heads the arachnid collection at CeNak.,
15755,He and his Australian colleague named the newly discovered spider species after Bob Marley.,
15756,This is what the Desis bobmarleyi looks like.,
15757,Here is a female specimen... ...,
15758,and here is a male specimen of the newly discovered spider species.,
15759,The Desis bobmarleyi is a new species of spider discovered in the corals of Australia.,
15760,"The spider has now been described for the first time in Evolutionary Systematics, the scientific journal published by the Center of Natural History (CeNak).",
15761,We asked spider researcher Dr. Danilo Harms why the spider was named after the reggae legend.,
15762,It’s mode of life.,
15763,It is one of the few species of spiders found in the ocean.,
15764,"The creatures live in the surf zone, on corals or stones.",
15765,"During high tide, they hide themselves in little self-woven air chambers similar to dive bells, enabling them to survive long phases of high tide.",
15766,At low tide the spiders crawl onto corals in search of food.,
15767,This is pretty unique.,
15768,"Normally, spiders are terrestrial animals.",
15769,"Both my colleague Barbara Baehr, who collected the spiders in Australia, and I like reggae.",
15770,"I often listen to reggae when working and while this song, “High Tide Low Tide,” was playing, I thought it perfectly described the spider’s mode of living.",
15771,"So it’s not a name based on outward similarities, although the spider is pretty hairy.",
15772,"The spider can also be found in Queensland, where there is a lot of sun and sand.",
15773,That’s perfect for reggae and Bob Marley.,
15774,We can proclaim a name ourselves.,
15775,It just has to conform to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.,
15776,These regulations define how to describe species.,
15777,"One requirement, for example, is that work is published in a scientific journal with several editions and is available in print.",
15778,"Furthermore, the name has to be given in line with several formal criteria, for example, it has to be Latinized.",
15779,That depends.,
15780,The chance of discovering a new spider species in Central Europe is relatively low.,
15781,This is due to the fact that spider diversity is lower here and the current state of specimens is already very good.,
15782,"In the tropics, however, there are a few areas in which 30–50% of all species haven’t been described yet.",
15783,"Recently, I was traveling around West Africa, where there are still many unknown species.",
15784,One problem of biodiversity research is that we live at a time in which we are losing a huge number of habitats.,
15785,And we are losing these species before we even discover them.,
15786,That’s why we don’t just describe new species morphologically; we also take tissue samples and save DNA in a biodiversity data bank for the future.,
15787,We don’t know exactly how widely distributed the spider is.,
15788,We assume that it can be found along the continent’s entire tropical east coast.,
15789,"What is clear is that it lives on corals and we are experiencing, also due to climate change, massive coral reef destruction.",
15790,"There is no study on whether this affects the spider population but at the moment I would not assume that we are talking about an endangered species.
",
15791,Nobel laureate Professor Esther Duflo discussed the climate crisis with researchers and interested members of the public from all over the world.,
15792,The event marked the opening of a biennial meeting between international university leaders.,
15793,University president Univ.-Prof.,
15794,Dr. Dr. h.c.,
15795,Dieter Lenzen welcomed the French-American researcher to the live stream.,
15796,"In his own speech, Professor Lenzen introduced the goals of the Global University Leaders Council Hamburg.",
15797,It is a platform for university leaders regularly to discuss social challenges and the role of higher-education institutions in overcoming them.,
15798,This year’s topic was climate change.,
15799,Professor Esther Duflo started her lecture with a question: why is climate change such a difficult topic to overcome politically?,
15800,"She observed that the wealthy nations of the global North are net contributors to the problem, while the poorer countries of the global South suffer most from its consequences.",
15801,It is due to this divide that the North has been lacking in its commitment to climate-related goals.,
15802,"Professor Duflo, who researches and lectures in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also emphasized that this may change.",
15803,"Approaches to solving the climate crisis need not be based on technical aspects alone: changing the behavior of populations makes a difference, too.",
15804,And Duflo believes that this can be achieved.,
15805,"During the panel discussion following the lecture, President of the German Rectors’ Conference (HRK) Professor Peter‐André Alt and President of the International Association of Universities Professor Pam Fredman agreed that universities have a particularly important role to play in this process.",
15806,They must be role models and start implementing the relevant measures on their own campuses.,
15807,"Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Town, emphasized that the perception of universities as institutions with outstanding climate goals can motivate students to take action against climate change.",
15808,"Professor Detlef Stammer, head of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and spokesperson for the Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS) at Universität Hamburg, agreed with Professor Duflo’s urgent appeal for immediate action.",
15809,Stammer underscored that global warming had already reached one degree Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution and that it would take much greater effort to slow down the impending rise in temperatures and lessen its impact.,
15810,"The event was held in English and moderated by the former editor in chief of DER SPIEGEL / SPIEGEL ONLINE, Dr. Barbara Hans.",
15811,She also asked the participants questions submitted by the audience.,
15812,"You can watch a recording of the lecture and the panel discussion on the website of the Global University Leaders Council Hamburg.

15813,[Students at the Faculty of Business Administration can complete two masters degrees within one program – an M.Sc.,
15814,in Business Administration from Universität Hamburg and an MBA from Kyoto University.,
15815,The program includes two semesters at the partner university.,
15816,"As part of the program, Ken Takada from Kyoto University has been in Hamburg since October 2022.",
15817,In an inverview he discusses his experiences.,
15818,", I’ve visited several Asian countries but this is my first time in Europe.",
15819,So everything is new for me – and a lot of things are different from home.,
15820,I have to get used to many things and it took some time to warm up.,
15821,"I live in a dorm which is nice because I’ve met many international students, as well as two other students from Japan.",
15822,The first months are also very busy.,
15823,"Parallel to getting settled, Im also starting my thesis at my home university, so I have to prepare several things for that.",
15824,"In addition, the courses have started and they’re quite different from what I know from Japan.",
15825,"In our university, we have lectures where the professor talks and we listen and take notes.",
15826,"In Hamburg we are expected to speak up and there is a lot more interaction and discussion.,",
15827,"For me, the biggest challenge is the language.",
15828,"I took English courses at my home university, but the teachers there speak Japanese.",
15829,So if I had questions or didnt know a word I could ask in Japanese.,
15830,"Now all my courses are in English and there is a lot of special vocabulary, but I cant ask for it to be translated into Japanese.",
15831,That means I have to achieve a higher level of language skills while taking the lectures.,
15832,", A friend at Kyoto University told me about it.",
15833,Most students study part-time in addition to working.,
15834,They dont have the time to study abroad for one year.,
15835,I study full time so he thought it would be a good opportunity.,
15836,", And it’s a really good fit because I’m very interested in how people learn in different contexts.",
15837,I did my bachelor’s degree in mathematics and now I’m doing my master’s degree in business administration.,
15838,I was intrigued by the differences in studying and learning between these two disciplines and wanted to experience studying in another country.,
15839,"Even after this short period of time, I’m convinced it was the right choice.",
15840,It’s a great opportunity to get to know another culture.,
15841,"You can read a lot about other countries, but you learn far more if you spend time there and have personal experience.",
15842,That’s why I highly recommend that all students of business administration at Universität Hamburg and at Kyoto University look into and apply for this program.,
15843,"Im taking all the courses the German students in my semester are taking, but I have two additional goals.",
15844,One is to get all possible elective courses that will help me with my thesis.,
15845,"It will be about digital transformation in industrial manufacturing companies, as well as innovation technology management.",
15846,"So I’m interested, for example, in the quantitative research methods course.",
15847,In addition to that Im really interested in Health Care Management.,
15848,"Since we dont have that specialty at my university, my second goal is to take as many courses as possible in Hamburg.",
15849,", I havent decided yet.",
15850,"I think I will start working in Japan first, but it would be great to get the chance to work abroad for some time.",
15851,"Maybe I can work with a Japanese company that has local branch in Europe.]
",
15852,Kyoto University has been one of Universität Hamburg’s strategic partners since July 2020.,
15853,"In an online meeting, the universities have now decided to hold a workshop in the fall, to develop joint perspectives on university development and encourage academic exchange.",
15854,"The meeting was called to meet the newly elected president of Kyoto University, Prof. Dr. Nagahiro Minato.",
15855,"In addition to a joint workshop planned, depending on the pandemic, for the third quarter of the year, the presidents spoke about projects that have already been completed since the beginning of the partnership.",
15856,"In terms of research, these include 2 large symposia comprising 7 disciplines and 60 participants each, and a range of joint publications, particularly in the area of logistics, biology, and social and political science.",
15857,There is also a central student exchange and continuing plans for joint teaching at the faculty level.,
15858,"Things have not stood still during the coronavirus pandemic, even with all the challenges that it has brought for international collaboration.",
15859,The beginning of April 2021 saw the implementation of an agreement between the Faculty of Business Administration and the Graduate School of Management at Kyoto University to offer a joint double master’s degree program.,
15860,"In the future, this offers the opportunity to obtain 2 master’s degrees, the Master of Business Administration from Universität Hamburg, and the Master of Business Administration from Kyoto University in only 6 semesters.",
15861,The first Universität Hamburg students can start in Kyoto from April 2022.,
15862,"Kyoto University is a state university with around 23,000 students and 2,800 academic staff.",
15863,The university was founded in 1897.,
15864,This makes it Japan’s second-oldest university.,
15865,"Alongside the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University is one of the country’s foremost universities and, with 11 Nobel laureates to date, also one of the most respected worldwide.",
15866,There has been a cooperation agreement between Universität Hamburg and Kyoto University since 2017.,
15867,"As part of its internationalization strategy, Universität Hamburg has already been expanding its network of international higher education partners since 2012.",
15868,"As a flagship university, a concept that facilitated its denomination as a “University of Excellence,” internationalization plays a major role.
",
15869,More than 400 research projects currently involving about 240 scientists and scholars at Universität Hamburg have a connection to the topic of sustainability.,
15870,"What projects these are and who is working on them—find out using the new interactive Sustainability Research Map, online now.",
15871,The projects on the interactive map are grouped according to institution and topic.,
15872,"The topics derive from the sustainability goals of the United Nations—the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—and are labelled “Basic Needs,” “Sustainable Infrastructure,” “Cities and Communities,” and “Governance,” for example.",
15873,"“The Sustainability Research Map makes the diversity of research at Universität Hamburg with a connection to sustainability visible,” says Sophie Palm from the Center for a Sustainable University (KNU).",
15874,The KNU provided guidance during the Map’s development.,
15875,The Map will be continually updated and expanded.,
15876,"Further projects at Universität Hamburg with a sustainability focus or connection can be registered via the online form.
",
15877,What holds Europe together?,
15878,This is the key question addressed by a new international conference hosted by Universität Hamburg in cooperation with the Villa Vigoni German-Italian Centre for the European Dialogue and other academic institutes.,
15879,The project will be financed from Excellence Strategy funds.,
15880,Representatives of the participating institutions are now introducing the conference and its goals in a video.,
15881,"The University’s president, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.",
15882,"Dieter Lenzen; Prof. Dr. Markus Kotzur, professor of European and international law at Universität Hamburg, president of the Europa Kolleg Hamburg, and head organizer of the conference; and Dr. Christiane Liermann Traniello, secretary general of the Villa Vigoni, initiated a dialogue on European policy matters that the Hamburg-Vigoni Forum will facilitate with various events in the future.",
15883,"Following a virtual event in September 2020, participants will begin seeking European answers to global questions in 2021, alternating between Villa Vigoni on Lake Como and Universität Hamburg.",
15884,"They will also discuss the importance of 3 major concepts for Europe: identity, sovereignty, and territory.",
15885,"The conference series should bring together researchers, policymakers, and the public to discuss these questions in an innovative way.",
15886,"It should also serve as a forum for exchange with workshops and talks with experts, in which—above all—young researchers take part.",
15887,"In Hamburg, the results will also be discussed with prominent politicians and the public.",
15888,One part of the concept is thus a talk on Europe by a top politician.,
15889,There are also plans for publications on the 3 focal areas.,
15890,"In addition to the University and Villa Vigoni, the Europa Kolleg Hamburg and the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy (IFSH) will be co-organizers.",
15891,"The Europa Kolleg Hamburg consolidates interdisciplinary expertise on European integration at its Institute for European Integration, an associated institute of Universität Hamburg.",
15892,"Researchers at the IFSH, also associated with Universität Hamburg, take an interdisciplinary approach to the conditions of peace and security in Germany, Europe, and beyond.",
15893,"The expansion of the international strategy conferences is an important building block in the flagship university concept, Innovating and Cooperating for a Sustainable Future, with which Universität Hamburg proved successful in the Excellence Strategy, a competition organized by the federal government and states to foster top research.",
15894,Villa Vigoni is a partner with long-standing experience.,
15895,"As a German-Italian center for European dialogue, the society’s staff regularly organize academic and international conferences as well as cultural events in the areas of academia, politics, economics, and art.

15896,"The powerful jets shooting out of black holes will be the focus of a new German Research Foundation (DFG) research group, which includes two researchers from the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe at Universität Hamburg.",
15897,The research group has been granted €3.6 million in funding.,
15898,Black holes are found at the center of almost all galaxies.,
15899,"Their mass is beyond imagination, sucking in material, gas, and even light.",
15900,"At the same time, massive amounts of energy in the form of jets are released into surrounding space.",
15901,"“Black holes sound abstract, but they have a major impact on our universe.",
15902,"That is what we are investigating in this research group,” explains Prof. Dr. Marcus Brüggen from the Hamburg Observatory of Universität Hamburg.",
15903,Dr. Manuel Meyer from the Institute of Experimental Physics is also working with the research group.,
15904,"The Hamburg subproject is focusing on radio observations of jets from black holes, including from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope.",
15905,"Jets are bundled plasma streams, that accelerate particles with massive amounts of energy, spewing out from the center of the galaxy at almost light speed.",
15906,"They can reach hundreds of thousands of lights years into space, sending out strong radio, x-ray, and gamma rays.",
15907,"So far, these jets have posed more questions than researchers have answers: What are they made of?",
15908,How do they start in the immediate vicinity of super-massive black holes?,
15909,"What processes are responsible for their high-energy radiation, and how does this interact with the parent galaxy?",
15910,The new research group Relativistic Jets in Active Galaxies is aiming to answer these questions.,
15911,"“The research group provides a brilliant opportunity to test theoretical predictions and simulations using the newest data and observations,” enthused Dr. Manuel Meyer.",
15912,"The German Research Foundation (DFG) will provide 3.6 million euros of funding to the group within the next four years, with astrophysicist Prof. Dr. Matthias Kadler from the Julius Maximilian University of Würzberg as the group’s spokesperson.",
15913,"In addition to Universität Hamburg, the group also involves members from the universities of Heidelberg, Erlangen-Nürnberg, the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam, and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and Radioastronomy in Heidelberg and Bonn.",
15914,"DFG research groups are intended to allow researchers to address current issues in their field, and to establish innovative new directions in research.",
15915,"The funds provided by the DFG are largely intended for new projects for early career researchers.
",
15916,Radiation from outer space continuously reaches Earth in the form of electrically charged particles.,
15917,"While many hail from the sun, there are also extremely energy-rich particles whose origins have remained unexplained since their discovery in the 1960s.",
15918,"Over 400 researchers from 18 countries are researching this phenomenon at the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina, the world’s largest hybrid detector to study high-energy cosmic rays.",
15919,"The researchers have now discovered that the rays come from outside our solar system and, with great probability, outside our own galaxy.",
15920,"As part of a collaborative project under the aegis of the Federal Ministry of Research, Prof. Dr. Günter Sigl from the Institute for Theoretical Physics II is heading a team from Universität Hamburg that will also take part in the research.",
15921,Particles smaller than atoms penetrate the atmosphere with the energy of a tennis ball hit with a hard swing.,
15922,"When they interact with molecules in the air, they split into so-called “secondary particles.”",
15923,"These are, for example, pions, meaning particles of about one-tenth the mass of a proton.",
15924,"These interact in turn with the atmosphere and create more secondary particles, resulting in a cascade.",
15925,This atmospheric shower continues until the energy per particle no longer suffices to produce further pions.,
15926,The Pierre Augur experiment allows us to measure the by-products of these particles.,
15927,"In 1912 Viktor Hess discovered that at greater altitudes, electroscopes (instruments for measuring a body’s electrical charges) discharged more quickly above Earth’s surface.",
15928,This could only be explained by ionizing radiation from outside Earth’s atmosphere.,
15929,"In 1938 Pierre Auger—for whom the experiment has been named—discovered coincidental signals in particle detectors separated by several meters, indicating the existence of expansive atmospheric showers.",
15930,"In the Pierre Auger experiment, researchers are trying to prove these showers using photomultipliers—extremely sensitive light sensors.",
15931,"They capture signals catalyzed by electrons, positrons, and muons.",
15932,The atmospheric showers also create flourescent rays that you can see with a telescope.,
15933,The detectors measure the particles’ direction of arrival.,
15934,"If the sources were located in our Milky Way, the direction of arrival would have to appear closer to our galaxy.",
15935,"The surplus of roughly 12% of particles arriving from one half of outer space relative to the particle rate from the other half indicates, however, a direction 120 degrees away from the galactic center.",
15936,The Hamburg group is a team of phenomenologists.,
15937,That means we describe processes and characteristics using theoretical models and we work at the junction of the experiment and astrophysical scenarios to interpret the data.,
15938,"In particular, we simulate cosmic ray distribution while focusing on interactions and perturbations in cosmic magnetic fields.",
15939,We will try to determine the sources of these particles.,
15940,"To do so, we will compare measurement results with model predictions and simulate arrival directions using various hypotheses for the distribution of sources and magnetic fields.",
15941,We want to find out which combination of protons and light and heavy atom nuclei we are dealing with.,
15942,"We are also working with particle physics groups at Universität Hamburg to do this.
",
15943,"Recently, universities have become popular targets for hackers.",
15944,"At the beginning of the year, Universität Hamburg was also confronted with a new wave of phishing mails.",
15945,University members need to be especially vigilant.,
15946,"The most important questions and answers for staff
",
15947,The Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging: Cluster of Excellence Advanced Imaging of Matter has developed a new funding concept.,
15948,The goal of the Young Investigator Group Leader concept is to provide the best support possible to highly talented early career researchers on their paths towards a professorship or leadership position.,
15949,One special feature is a structured program that includes a development center to provide individualized support.,
15950,Seven young investigator group leaders have already begun their work at The Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging:,
15951,Cluster of Excellence Advanced Imaging.,
15952,The newly created positions target young researchers who are already conducting their own ambitious independent research projects and are applying for or have already acquired funding at the level of Emmy Noether research groups or ERC Starting Grants.,
15953,The researchers receive support from one or more “hosts” and their research projects form part of the hosts’ own projects or research groups.,
15954,This concept allows the early career researchers to conduct their research largely independently while benefiting from the host group’s resources.,
15955,One special feature of the concept is a development plan to provide individual support.,
15956,The main question here is what do the researchers need to pursue their next career goals?,
15957,“The starting point is the voluntary development center.,
15958,"This should help young investigators identify the development fields that are personally important to them,” says Prof Henning Moritz, who oversees the new program jointly with the cluster’s managing director Anika Ostermaier-Grabow and career counselor Jutta Voigtmann.",
15959,"Arne Seeburger, who advises on HR diagnostics for Universität Hamburg, is lending a hand with the conception, preparation, implementation, and evaluation of the development center, which forms the core of the new support concept.",
15960,"In these half-day workshops, prepared in meetings and discussions, the young investigators are charged with practical tasks and take part in leadership simulations.",
15961,"On the basis of the results, they receive a personal development plan.",
15962,"Depending on their needs, they then take workshops, receive coaching, or meet with others to exchange ideas and reflect upon their progress every 6 months.",
15963,"“I think it’s very good that the program is so individual and that is focuses on personal development needs,” says Dr. Philipp Wessels-Staarmann, one of the 7 young investigators.",
15964,"Going through the development center, he continues, is such a valuable experience because you then understand how an assessment center in an academic search procedure works.",
15965,"Irene Fernandez-Cuesta, who is also taking part in the project, adds: “The development center was a very interesting experience.",
15966,It definitely helped me to learn more about myself and to see things from a different perspective.,
15967,"I got useful feedback from colleagues and, above all, from experts.”",
15968,"With the Young Investigator Group Leaders concept, the Cluster of Excellence Advanced Imaging of Matter is realizing the goal of supporting early career researchers, which it has firmly established in its research program and for which over 80 percent of the funding is earmarked.",
15969,"“If it goes well, we will offer the development program for other cluster researchers outside the Young Investigator project at the brink of their next career move so that we can support them more individually,” hopes Ostermaier-Grabow.
",
15970,"This year, Universität Hamburg is financing research projects through its Knowledge Exchange Fund under the theme “The New Normal: Sustainable Development during a Pandemic.”",
15971,"Here, we introduce 2 of the 12 financed projects.",
15972,"People rarely question routines, such as their choice of transportation, for example.",
15973,"“Normally, this is only the case if a change in biography takes place—for example, if someone moves to the countryside or to the suburbs,” explains Dr. Christoph Hafenburg, a geographer who applied for funding for the project on postpandemic commuting together with Prof. Dr. Jürgen Oßenbrügge.",
15974,"For the 2 researchers, the coronavirus pandemic is, in contrast, an example of how external factors fundamentally challenge people’s actions and decisions.",
15975,"According to Haferburg, “Two trends have emerged since the pandemic began: First, fewer people are commuting due to new regulations on working from home.",
15976,"Second, commuters have become increasingly dependent on individual transport, using cars and bicycles—to the detriment of public transport.”",
15977,Against the backdrop of a prepandemic public transport system that was stretched to capacity and aspirations to transform transportation—key words “climate neutrality”—Haferburg and Oßenbrügge want to better understand the decisions that commuters make.,
15978,"To do this, they will conduct qualitative interviews and evaluate them according to—for example—respondents’ economic sector, family situation, or place of residence.",
15979,They will also talk to politicians and company executives about transportation of the future.,
15980,"“The insights we gain will hopefully help decision makers find the right tools to ensure sustainable traffic flows in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region region in postpandemic times,” says Haferburg.",
15981,Devices that can perform liquid biopsies quickly and automatically and are so small that they can be found in any doctor’s office and hospital—this is what the physicist Dr. Irene Fernandez-Cuesta wants.,
15982,“Liquid biopsy” is the term used to describe the analysis of blood samples in order to obtain information about the regression or growth of tumors or about the formation of metastases.,
15983,"This technique has the potential to make the removal of tissue samples for biopsies unnecessary, which would bring enormous relief for cancer sufferers.",
15984,Many cancer patients were not looked after closely enough during the coronavirus pandemic.,
15985,This method could help to ensure that examinations are perceived as less burdensome and that results are available quickly.,
15986,“Liquid biopsies require complex examinations in highly specialized laboratories.,
15987,"I hope that our work will help in making these accessible and quick,” explains Dr. Fernandez-Cuesta.",
15988,"With the help of the financial support she receives from the Knowledge Exchange Fund, Dr. Fernandez-Cuesta wants to hire a technician to validate devices that she and her team have already developed.",
15989,The technician will be tasked with analyzing samples from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) for a year and comparing the results with the hospital’s latest findings.,
15990,"“This means that our work is also suitable for strengthening the exchange of knowledge between the Department of Physics at Universität Hamburg and the UKE and for consolidating and expanding the cooperation,” says the junior research group leader, whose research was partially funded with an ERC Starting Grant in 2017.",
15991,The Knowledge Exchange Fund is financed through the Excellence Initiative of the Federal and State Governments.,
15992,"The funded researchers receive up to EUR 30,000.",
15993,"See the list (PDF in German only) of all funded projects, and find more information on Knowledge Exchange Agency’s web pages.
",
15994,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
15995,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
15996,"Prof. Dr. Dieter Jaksch will join the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences in the winter semester 2021/22 from the University of Oxford as a professor for Theory of many body quantum optical systems.",
15997,He will work at the Institute of Laser Physics and conduct research in the Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter.,
15998,I investigate interactions between light fields and quantum matter in non-equilibrium states.,
15999,My aim is to find and understand new functional properties of these hybrid systems.,
16000,Subsequently these can then be utilized in novel quantum technologies.,
16001,Progress in digitization brings conventional classical information processing methods to their physical limits.,
16002,I investigate if quantum mechanical superpositions of light and matter possess properties which allow the development of novel quantum technologies for information processing.,
16003,A detailed understanding of those states and their properties is necessary to develop technologies like e.g. quantum computers or quantum simulators.,
16004,I am convinced that quantum effects will in the future also increasingly be utilized to make conventional electronics components faster and more efficient.,
16005,My work focuses on researching complex interactions between light and matter and aim to understand them well enough to enable experimentalists to control and exploit them in the laboratory.,
16006,I mainly use analytical and numerical mathematical methods for the theoretical description of many-body quantum systems.,
16007,I got to know Hamburg as a cosmopolitan and dynamic city which is aware of the importance of fundamental research and a top quality scientific education.,
16008,I am now looking forward to getting to know the city and its people better and make use of the broad range of facilities and events.,
16009,The University of Hamburg at its excellence cluster CUI focus strongly on researching non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body systems.,
16010,A broad and interdisciplinary group of researchers has been formed in my area of research.,
16011,This extends far beyond the traditional confines of physics and I am particularly looking forward to discuss science with colleagues from neighbouring fields of research.,
16012,I am convinced that some quantum technologies will reach industrial relevance within the next decade.,
16013,Moreover methods that were originally developed for solving quantum mechanical many-body problems are being repurposed to e.g. solve problems in logistics or aerodynamics.,
16014,In order to exploit the potential arising from this development in Hamburg we will need outstandingly well trained quantum scientists.,
16015,I intend to strengthen teaching of courses that providing optimal training for these challenges and provide a deep and broad understanding of a range of different quantum technologies.,
16016,Quantum physics is a fascinating subject which allows us to describe physical phenomena that entirely disagree with our everyday experience.,
16017,"Only now, we are learning how to exploit these quantum effect in novel technologies.",
16018,"Thus, it is now the ideal point in time to engage deeply with quantum physics to then be able to actively contribute to the development of novel quantum technologies.",
16019,"I have collaborative UK research projects with colleagues from the University of Strathclyde, the University of Durham, Imperial College and the University of Cambridge.",
16020,"Through a joint ERC project I have been collaborating with the University of Geneva, the Center for Computational Quantum Physics at the Flatiron Institute in New York, Collège de France and the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg for the past seven years.",
16021,"In addition, I have been a Visiting Research Professor am Centre for Quantum Technologies in Singapore since 2009.
",
16022,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
16023,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
16024,"Prof. Dr. Eleanor Frajka-Williams joined Universität Hamburg in July 2022 as a Professor for Ocean Dynamics in a Changing Climate, in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, as well as the Center of Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) and the Cluster of Excellence “Climate, Climatic Change, and Society” (CLICCS).",
16025,"I study the ocean circulation, how it is responding to climate change and how they are driving climate change.",
16026,"For example, I investigate how the Gulf Stream and the ocean conveyor system redistribute heat around the Atlantic.",
16027,"I am also interested in how, as the climate warms and polar ice caps melt, the increase in freshwater changes the ocean circulation.",
16028,"I am an ‘experimental’ physical oceanographer which in this case means I make measurements of the oceans as they are today: how warm or salty the water is, and how quickly it is moving or mixing.",
16029,"With these measurements, I try to figure out the physical processes of water movement and water transformation (changes in temperature or salinity), or how the oceans are interacting with the atmosphere or cryosphere.",
16030,"Some of what we measure can be difficult to simulate accurately in ocean and climate models, and so these measurements enable us to better understand basic processes and can provide a valuable check on climate simulations.",
16031,Because it is both super interesting and fundamentally important to a healthy future for humans on planet earth.,
16032,"Originally, I discovered the field of oceanography because it was a way to combine my interest in math and computing with a love of the outdoors.",
16033,I am focusing on understanding the processes of climate change.,
16034,"How does the ocean interact with the cryosphere, the atmosphere?",
16035,"It´s basic research that helps us get an accurate view of how the oceans change today, and can help improve climate projections on the long run.",
16036,I plan to expand the capability of experimental oceanography in Hamburg towards using both long-term underwater moored observations and autonomous platforms like gliders.,
16037,These equipment will substantially improve our ability to measure small-scale processes (centimeter to 10s of kilometers) in remote regions like the polar oceans.,
16038,These are areas which are historically under-sampled due to the presence of sea-ice and bad weather—two things which complicate traditional measurements by ship.,
16039,"More broadly, I am also looking forward to working with colleagues in the CEN and CLICCS – the diversity of expertise represented means that—by working together—we can better place our science in the broader context of the Earth system, and better understand how the changing climate is impacting society.",
16040,To get a hands-on view of what is going on in the oceans.,
16041,"It is essential and valuable to learn the equations which describe ocean circulation, and how the oceans interact with other parts of the Earth system.",
16042,"However, I hope to provide more hands-on experience including things like: using small rotating tables to ‘watch’ ocean eddies and gyres in the classroom, how to use ocean instruments to make climate-quality measurements, how to plan fieldwork and how to analyse in situ observations once you have them.",
16043,I hope to convey a sense of the adventure as well as the science of ‘doing oceanography’.,
16044,Hamburg is a strong center of excellence for climate science in Germany with both CEN and CLICCS.,
16045,So I am looking forward to working with new colleagues and to connecting my work on the oceans with the societal impacts of climate change.,
16046,"I also really love the city of Hamburg itself, with the eclectic combination of old and new buildings, excellent public transport and bike paths, and the cityscape interspersed with parks and water—at least canals and the Elbe river, even if there are no oceans nearby!
",
16047,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
16048,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
16049,"Prof. Dr. Juan Pedro Mellado Gonzalez currently at Polytechnic University of Catalonia is joining Universität Hamburg as a Professor for Small-Scale Atmospheric Modeling, in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences as well as the Cluster of Excellence “Climate, Climatic Change, and Society” (CLICCS), starting in Winter Semester 2021/22.",
16050,My research focuses on microscale atmospheric processes and their interaction with larger-scale dynamics.,
16051,I am particularly interested in turbulence and how it interacts with other phenomena such as cloud microphysics and radiative transfer.,
16052,This allows us to use climate and weather models more reliably.,
16053,"Climate models explicitly represent down to kilometer scales, but smaller features need to be modeled.",
16054,"Look around and see the challenge: clouds, vegetation, water surfaces, urban areas.",
16055,How do we do it?,
16056,This is what I try to answer.,
16057,I combine theory and simulations.,
16058,"With current supercomputers, we can easily simulate 1010 degrees of freedom.",
16059,"This figure seems huge, but it is minute compared to nature.",
16060,"Moreover, simulations necessarily simplify the original problem.",
16061,"That is why we still need a strong theoretical basis, to appropriately define these simulations and to appropriately interpret the results.",
16062,"My goal is to understand the atmosphere better, and this has applications to climate research, air quality, renewable energy, and transportation.",
16063,"Advancing small-scale modeling will be, I believe, instrumental in developing the next generation of weather and climate models, where kilometer-scale resolution represents a change of paradigm with respect to the last half century.",
16064,"Together with the current expertise at the university and its partner institutions, we can create a synergy for process studies that span from millimeter scales to planetary scales, that combines simulations, field measurements and laboratory studies, and that applies to weather and climate research as well as to environmental flows.",
16065,Such a synergy will be quite unique worldwide.,
16066,"When I teach, I try to covey my fascination about how the atmosphere works.",
16067,"It is challenging: the system is chaotic, and we need to describe it statistically; environmental conditions are continuously changing, adding variability; the devil is often in the details, and we need accuracy.",
16068,"And yet, we understand quite a lot of how the atmosphere works!",
16069,"For specific process studies, I collaborate with colleagues from the USA, the Netherlands and Spain.",
16070,"For applications to climate studies, one collaborates with groups all over Europe.",
16071,"Within Germany, I am currently working with TU Ilmenau, KIT, University of Bayreuth, University of Bremen, the Leipzig Institute for Tropospheric Research and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.",
16072,...,
16073,the city is cosmopolitan but with a local flare within the neighborhoods.,
16074,"The University and the city are a worldwide prestigious hub for climate research, curious students and researchers.
",
16075,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
16076,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
16077,Paul Wedrich recently joined the Department of Mathematics as a Professor for Cohomological Methods.,
16078,He explains his fascination with a research area that challenges our powers of imagination.,
16079,"Prior to his move to Hamburg, Paul Wedrich worked at the University of Bonn and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics.",
16080,I use algebraic structures inspired by quantum physics to explore low-dimensional manifolds and knots; the latter can essentially be likened to knots in a rope.,
16081,"I specialize in homology theories for knots, which can be used to measure characteristics of a temporal evolution of knots.",
16082,This enables the detection of subtle differences between smooth 4-dimensional manifolds.,
16083,"Just like in all other scientific fields, measuring instruments are available in mathematics.",
16084,Mathematicians refer to these as invariants and use them to explore mathematical objects such as knots.,
16085,"These invariants often work algorithmically, which means that we’re able to use formulas to get a computer to calculate them for us.",
16086,I employ theoretical methods and computer experiments to develop and investigate such measurement instruments.,
16087,"Invariants are building blocks for topological quantum field theories, which we investigate in great depth within the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe.",
16088,Cohomological methods allow us to access powerful new examples of such topological theories in 4 dimensions.,
16089,This is probably the most interesting number of dimensions—both in mathematics and in everyday life—in which we experience 4-dimensional space-time.,
16090,"The research area of particle, astro- and mathematical physics offers the ideal interdisciplinary environment for my research.",
16091,"I find it particularly exciting to be involved in conception of the new teacher training programs, and look forward to exchanging with my new colleagues and to meeting countless interested students.",
16092,"Hamburg is a versatile, liberal, and future-oriented city, and I’m absolutely delighted to be back close to the ideal location for wind and water sports after a few years away from the coast.",
16093,I find it fascinating how vivid everyday situations can be translated into sophisticated mathematical constructions on the one hand and how such constructions can broaden our perception and hone our intuition on the other.,
16094,"A great many people have an intuitive notion of a wormhole, for example, which is a kind of cosmic tunnel that provides a hypothetical shortcut between 2 otherwise distant points in space.",
16095,"In mathematics, we refer to this as a 1-handle as it can be likened to a handle on a cup.",
16096,"Things only get really interesting when we also allow 2-handles though: these are also shortcuts in space—not between 2 points, but rather from all points on a knot to one another.",
16097,Once you understand this—and mathematical tools can help here—you can use knots to describe various forms of 3- and even 4-dimensional spaces.,
16098,So anyone who has always wanted to be able to imagine 4-dimensional objects and also draw them is in the right place here!,
16099,There are a number of high-profile research programs in my field around the world.,
16100,"Among others, I am involved in collaborative projects with colleagues at universities in Bonn, Montpellier, Stanford, and Sydney as well as at the Microsoft Station Q in Santa Barbara.",
16101,My scientific research is based on questions such as “What forms can 4-dimensional space take?” and “How can they be distinguished?”.,
16102,This is essentially basic research.,
16103,"In the medium and longer term, applications using quantum computers and knotted biopolymers are conceivable.",
16104,I believe the greatest impact of my work on society lies in teaching.,
16105,Our daily lives are increasingly shaped by technologies that have an ever more complex mathematical basis.,
16106,I think it is important for a democratic society to have a broad understanding of this basis as far as possible.,
16107,"And I would like to contribute to this through my teaching.
",
16108,The sociologist Prof. Dr. Sabine Maasen is switching to Universität Hamburg for a professorship newly created within the context of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.,
16109,She will serve as the academic director of the Transfer Agency that is currently being set up.,
16110,"Most recently, Sabine Maasen—newly appointed to Universität Hamburg—held the Friedrich Schiedel Endowed Chair in the Sociology of Science at the Technical University of Munich.",
16111,"She is a member of the German Science Council, one of Germany’s most important councils for scientific policy.",
16112,"In Hamburg, she will not only teach and research; she will also actively shape knowledge transfer between the University and society, the general public, policy makers, and industry as part of the Transfer Agency.",
16113,I want to understand how science affects individuals and society as a whole.,
16114,I look at individual changes and the constant change in which our society finds itself—and the question as to how this change affects science and scholarship.,
16115,"On the one hand, it requires science and scholarship to change.",
16116,"On the other hand, scientific findings inspire changes in society.",
16117,The entanglements are manifold.,
16118,I see it as a great opportunity to help shape the Transfer Agency and the academic culture at the University.,
16119,"I dream of nothing less than comprehensive cultural change, both at Universität Hamburg and in the entire country.",
16120,"In my view, transfer is a central requirement for researchers.",
16121,I do not want researchers to see this as an additional burden but as an integral part of their work—and ideally as something that they can consider from the very outset of their projects.,
16122,Developing institutions that facilitate cooperation between academics in very different subjects has long been one of my focal points and topics of interest.,
16123,"This is because, in my experience, interdisciplinarity works only in a clear, suitable context.",
16124,Developing and shaping these conditions for the Transfer Agency will undoubtedly take up a majority of my time in the coming year.,
16125,"Long-term, however, I certainly plan to make the work of the Transfer Agency itself a subject for self-reflective research.",
16126,I am excited about working at a comprehensive university again after my tenure at a technical university.,
16127,"I hope to find an even wider range of topics, encounters, and possible interrelations here.
",
16128,"For many intensive care patients, pressure on the brain must be monitored vigilantly and diagnosis depends strongly on the attending physician’s experience.",
16129,The neurologist Dr. Nils Schweingruber from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) has developed an AI-based system that recognizes critical phases up to 24 hours in advance.,
16130,Our series Doing the Research introduces research projects at Universität Hamburg.,
16131,"If the brain has been damaged due to injury, bleeding, or a massive stroke, it often responds by swelling.",
16132,"But the hard bones of the skull do not give to make room for swelling, so the pressure increases in the cranial cavities and blood circulation in the brain decreases.",
16133,"This can lead to further, often serious and irrevocable brain damage.",
16134,"The system we developed analyzes the most various medical data of gravely ill patients using methods of machine learning, for example blood pressure, breathing parameters, lab findings, medications, body temperature, age, sex, size, and weight.",
16135,"Thus, critical findings are often recognized in good time and often point to increasing brain pressure, possible brain artery spasms, or brain fog.",
16136,Attending physicians can therefore respond to changes in patients’ conditions in a more timely fashion.,
16137,"At the moment, we can use our prognosis program to predict a critical brain pressure phase up to 24 hours in advance and also to determine how long, roughly, it will last.",
16138,We are currently developing a possible assistance software for future use.,
16139,It’s important that the attending physicians continue to maintain complete control of treatment.,
16140,"Clinical, machine-learning based assistance software has the great advantage of being able to warn the attending physicians about potential dangers.",
16141,"Responding to changes in a patient’s condition, however, remains a central medical task.",
16142,"In the future, machine learning will play a greater role in patient-oriented, individual medicine.",
16143,"For the development of the prognosis software, large, anonymized data sets from patients treated in the intensive care units of the UKE were used.",
16144,We used more than 12 million data points for the study.,
16145,"The software was also validated using anonymized, intensive care data from US American databases.",
16146,"For our study, we benefit from the UKE’s high degree of digitalization and are already planning further studies to review the direct clinical use of the AI system.",
16147,"In the future and against the backdrop of increasing digitalization in the health system, machine learning will play an ever greater role in patient-oriented, individual medicine.",
16148,Intensive medicine especially will be able to avail itself in the future of even larger numbers of measurements by the most various of digital sensors.,
16149,"Machine learning will be crucial here to handle the variety of medical data and make precise, individual predictions about critical events.

16150,"Under the aegis of Désirée Kaiser, 10 students analyzed more than 150 letters to and from the front in a student research project.",
16151,"During the First World War, Linda and Paul Trompelt wrote each other numerous letters,which have survived to this day.",
16152,"Paul Trompelt sketched the system of trenches in his section of the front, among other things, for his wife.",
16153,"The students edited and annotated the letters, and also explored what roles and what concepts of relationships between men and women are evident in them.",
16154,Kaiser:,
16155,"Paul and Linda are 2 voices out of millions, the letters 150 out of billions, and “we have brought these two figures back to life to stand in for all those others.”",
16156,How does love function in war?,
16157,"To find this out, 10 students examined a trove of letters between a husband at the front and his wife at home during the First World War.",
16158,The student-led seminar project earned its organizers more than just credit points.,
16159,"“Dearest Paul,” Linda Trompelt begins her letter on 19 January 1917.",
16160,She writes to her husband at the French front to tell him that he is her “dearest” and that she will send him a parcel of fat the following day that he should please not eat if already rancid upon arrival.,
16161,"For Ronja Ewert this letter is special: “Paul corrected the letter and, using a colored pencil, inserted commas everywhere.”",
16162,"Even though, as Tabea Henn adds, “his spelling and punctuation were much worse than hers.”",
16163,"Together with 7 other students under the aegis of Désirée Kaiser, Ewert and Henn collated an annotated edition of more than 150 front letters that the couple wrote to each other between January 1915 and November 1918.",
16164,"For historians, compiling an “annotated edition” entails deciphering the letters, typing them up, and providing explanatory comments for the reader according to predetermined criteria.",
16165,The result of this project is a some 400-page book containing the edited and annotated correspondence as well as an essay by each student involved in the project on a particular research question.,
16166,Désirée Kaiser discovered the collection of letters during her research and purchased them privately from a militaria dealer.,
16167,"Kaiser, now a doctoral candidate, offered the research project during her master’s degree as a seminar in the Faculty of Humanities in 2016.",
16168,“Our overriding topic was the question of how intimate relationships during war function through the medium of the letter and to what extent concepts of “the couple” are shored up through these letters: in effect a gender-theoretical approach.”,
16169,"On the one hand, women were expected to strengthen the morale of their husbands-in-combat through letters from home; instructions andpresentations taught women how to write good letters to the front.",
16170,"On the other, these letters provided the only means for couples such as Paul and Linda to keep in contact.",
16171,"“We see how the authors place the relationship over language, how couples attempt intimacy, and how the letters bring forth clandestine meeting points,” explains Kaiser.",
16172,"The concept of a “relationship” was, however, very different to the one we have today.",
16173,"“Especially in that past society where the man had the say, the letter also serves to sustain this hierarchy,” explains Kaiser, who researches in literature.",
16174,"And so Linda directs questions about new purchases to her husband who, according to Kaiser, “organizes the day-to-day at home from the front.”",
16175,"“You know that I have long wanted a [wardrobe] and now sometimes there are some cheap ones, I think 50 Mark would buy a really lovely one, but that can wait until you come home, I just want to write to you of it.”",
16176,"Lines like this posed an even greater challenge to the students: “As there was a lot of censorship, the letters were actually unbelievably low on content.",
16177,"It’s always phrases like: ‘I am faithful to you,’ ‘I am yours forever,’ ‘I love you,’” says Ewert, whose essay explores the importance of religion for the Trompelt couple.",
16178,"“But that just spurred us on to hone our perspective,” Kaiser adds.",
16179,"This triviality, she maintains, is in itself worthy of investigation, “when one takes into account the conditions under which these letters were written.”",
16180,"At the outset, the students knew little more of the couple than that their first names were Linda and Paul.",
16181,"Later on they discovered that “home” was in Saxony and, by sheer accident, Paul’s last name.",
16182,"Armed with this information, history student Tabea Henn consulted the registry of births, marriages, and deaths responsible for the Trompelt’s district today—with success.",
16183,"She found out Paul’s and Linda’s full names, when they married, that they had had a daughter who died in 2015 and whose estate was the source of the letters.",
16184,"“At one stage I began to really shiver with excitement,” Henn remembers.",
16185,"And into the bargain, she chanced upon a picture of the Trompelts from 1916 in one of the daughter’s publications.",
16186,"“That really was a stroke of unbelievably good luck, as prior to that we hardly knew anything about them; we didn’t even know if Paul had survived the war,” the 21-year-old says with excitement.",
16187,All of a sudden they had faces to go with the words in the letters.,
16188,"Using this new information, Henn traced Paul’s stations on the front.",
16189,“And Linda last night you lay next to me as if I was home,
16190,I [wanted] to embrace my sweet heart,
16191,[but] there I held the wall and the dream was passed.”,
16192,"“Those are the moments that you feel with your subjects,” Henn confesses.",
16193,"“At one stage I was a little sad about the fact that they will never know that they have made it into the history books, that their letters have such great importance for the world.”",
16194,For Kaiser it was precisely this connection to the couple that proved the motivation: “I felt a little like I owed it to both of them to turn out a really good publication.”,
16195,"Paul and Linda, Kaiser explains, are 2 voices out of millions, the letters 150 out of billions, and “we have brought these two figures back to life to stand in for all those others.”",
16196,"“Greetings from the deepest place in my heart from your good and grateful Linda”
",
16197,Events surrounding Prof. Dr. Bernd Lucke resumption of teaching duties have concerned students and staff at Universität Hamburg as well as the media.,
16198,University management has been confronted with many questions which we have put together and answered below.,
16199,"The University had already consulted many times with police, a process in which Prof. Dr. Lucke was involved and present, and an agreed procedure was put in place.",
16200,"It was, and is, the view of the University, that given the number of people from outside the University, the University did not have the appropriate means to prevent disruption nor was the use of violence advisable.",
16201,University management was in constant contact with the police.,
16202,"As an institution devoted to research and teaching, the University does not have expertise in directing security forces.",
16203,"In order to allow the upcoming lecture by Prof. Dr. Lucke to proceed with as little disruption as possible, a private security company has been engaged to monitor entrance to the lecture hall.",
16204,This is intended to ensure that only those students who are registered for the course may enter.,
16205,Registered students will also have the opportunity to follow the lecture via livestream.,
16206,These students have already been informed of these measures.,
16207,Security staff analysis suggests that at no point was anyone present in any physical danger.,
16208,The security plan was developed in close collaboration with the police and with Prof. Dr. Lucke.,
16209,At no point was Prof. Dr. Lucke in any physical danger.,
16210,The University had agreed upon a procedure with the police and,
16211,"Prof. Dr. Lucke long before Prof. Lucke’s first lecture, and confirmed it several times.",
16212,"In addition, Prof. Dr. Lucke was informed before the lectures that he, as the lecturer and therefore organizer of the course, was responsible for the lecture and would have to discontinue it if the lecture hall became too full.",
16213,"Prof. Dr. Lucke did not follow this recommendation during the first lecture on 16 October 2019; rather, he stayed in the room, sitting among the students in his lecture.",
16214,"The University is currently in consultation with the police, and has expanded its preventative security measures.",
16215,"This is intended to ensure, for example, that only those students who are registered for the course may enter.",
16216,"Charges have been filed against unknown persons for a range of offenses including damage to property, insult, coercion, and others.",
16217,Criminal consequences will be decided upon by the public prosecutor.,
16218,"The Academic Senate of Universität Hamburg had already decided on 12 September 2019 to convene a working group for protecting academic freedoms, based on a suggestion made by the University president.",
16219,The main task of this working group is to document and analyze any kind of encroachment on academic freedom and put forward strategies for combating these in the future.,
16220,The president invited the working group to a constitutive meeting which will also address the controversy surrounding the first lecture by Prof. Dr. Lucke.,
16221,University management is emphatically committed to the view that disruptions to lectures are anathema to the fundamental protection of academic freedom.,
16222,"Differences of opinion at a university should be resolved using sound argument, discussion, and a search for consensus, not the exercise of violence of any kind.",
16223,"In addition to the teaching staff responsible for the course, only students enrolled in the relevant degree program and registered in our STiNE campus system are permitted to attend lectures.",
16224,Lectures at Universität Hamburg are not open to people outside of the University.,
16225,Members of the press are also not allowed to attend.,
16226,"We cannot issue an accreditation or authorization to film a lecture by Prof. Dr. Lucke or any other professor, nor to film in the area in front of the lecture hall.",
16227,"Lectures that are part of normal teaching duties are not open to the public, and in accordance with the Hamburg higher education act (Hamburgisches Hochschulgesetz, HmbHG), only students have the right to attend these lectures.",
16228,"In addition, the presence of the media would strongly influence the lecture process and the confidentiality of the lecture and its attendees.",
16229,This also applies to the areas around the lecture hall.,
16230,Universität Hamburg must guarantee that students can move freely within the area protected by the University.,
16231,This includes ruling out the risk of being filmed within University buildings.,
16232,There was no leave of absence.,
16233,The rights and obligations arising from the employment of a civil servant elected to the European Parliament are automatically suspended for the duration of that posting without requiring an application for a leave of absence (Section 8 subsection 3 Members of the European Parliament Act in conjunction with Section 5 subsection 1 Members of the Bundestag Act).,
16234,"As Professor Lucke is a university teacher employed by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, this also applies to him.",
16235,"As with any university teacher leaving politics, he returns to his professorship after serving in parliament.",
16236,"He therefore has the same obligations as every other university teacher, including engaging in research, teaching, and academic self-governance.",
16237,The resources allocated to his professorship are consistent with the duties he is required to perform.,
16238,"In accordance with the teaching obligation regulation at institutions of higher education in Hamburg (Lehrverpflichtungsverordnung für die Hamburger Hochschulen, LVVO), his obligatory teaching load is currently 9 teaching hours.",
16239,The fundamental rights and duties of every university teacher include the right to freely conduct their academic work and teaching.,
16240,The state is obliged to guarantee the exercise of these rights.,
16241,"University management must therefore ensure that these lectures can take place, in consultation with politicians and regulatory authorities.",
16242,"Within the scope of its capacity, Universität Hamburg had taken extensive safety precautions to allow Prof. Dr. Lucke’s lecture to take place.",
16243,A comprehensive security plan was developed in close consultation with the police and with private security firms who were present in large numbers.,
16244,"However, a university cannot act against the use of violence.",
16245,"In efforts to prevent protesters, some with their faces covered, from violently forcing their way into the lecture hall, 2 security staff members were injured.",
16246,"The Executive University Board points out that establishing safety and order are not part of the educational mission of a state-run academic organization, and that it has reached the limits of feasible action on this front.",
16247,"Ensuring that universities and academia can fulfill their fundamental duties across Germany as a whole is a political matter and should be addressed at a governmental level.
",
16248,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
16249,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
16250,"On 1 October 2021, Prof. Dr. Freya Blekman took up a Helmholtz Distinguished Professorship in experimental physics—a joint appointment by Universität Hamburg and DESY.",
16251,Blekman previously worked at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.,
16252,"I am a particle physicist interested in the smallest building blocks of matter, known as elementary particles.",
16253,"To perform my research, I use the Compact Muon Solenoid Detector in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva.",
16254,I also study the feasibility of future particle accelerators.,
16255,I help lay the groundwork for huge experiments that explore fundamental questions about nature such as “What are the building blocks of all matter?”,
16256,and “How did the universe evolve?”.,
16257,"To do this, I use one of the largest machines ever built, the Large Hadron Collider.",
16258,"This is a very difficult task, so I work together with several thousand intelligent, motivated colleagues from all over the world.",
16259,"One of my primary objectives is making the research we do at CERN, which is sometimes regarded as highly complex, accessible to the general public.",
16260,"At present, I am coordinating science communication for the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, in which some 4,000 international researchers are taking part. . .",
16261,".Hamburg is a wonderful, green city with an excellent reputation and heritage.",
16262,I am excited about being part of new scientific achievements of historic importance in the future.,
16263,My research in the CMS experiment at CERN ties in perfectly with the outstanding work already being performed at Quantum Universe.,
16264,My search for new particles will ideally complement this work.,
16265,"In addition, my research on future colliders will strengthen the cluster, as will my expertise in communicating complicated physics research.",
16266,"I am starting out as a research professor, so I will not be offering many classes right away.",
16267,"However, students in my classes can expect modern teaching methods such as project work and integrated learning in which they will play an active role in the course and the learning process.",
16268,"What is more, I have long-standing experience in supervising bachelor’s and master’s theses, which yield projects for academic publication for many students.",
16269,"In addition to my connections to CERN and to research institutions in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, I am a visiting professor at the University of Oxford and have strong connections to the United States in my role as a Distinguished Researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. . . .",
16270,support underrepresented groups and attempt to keep them at the University.,
16271,"In addition, I am a great fan of performance and contemporary art and love any activities related to these art forms.",
16272,Particle physics is one of the research fields in physics that try to answer fundamental questions about our world.,
16273,"These questions are almost philosophical in nature, yet we need very concrete, modern technology to investigate them.",
16274,Many of the developments originally stemming from particle physics research are useful for everyone.,
16275,One famous example is the World Wide Web.,
16276,"A more recent example is the new three-dimensional, color X-ray images based on particle physics technologies.
",
16277,"An interdisciplinary research team from Universität Hamburg and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron wants to develop a new inexpensive, fast, and portable test for the screening of infections with SARS-CoV-2.",
16278,The research team anticipates a prototype in 1.5 years.,
16279,"According to the Robert Koch Institute, more than 26 million laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been carried out in Germany to date and a large number will be added in the coming weeks.",
16280,"The two currently available test methods require either extensive processing in the laboratory, which costs time (PCR method = real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) or are not sensitive enough to correctly diagnose patients with even a low viral load (rapid tests).",
16281,"“We want to develop a highly sensitive test for the coronavirus that works much faster and does not require a laboratory,” says Dr. Irene Fernandez-Cuesta from the Department of Physics at Universität Hamburg.",
16282,The test should also be quantitative in order to detect infections in the early stages.,
16283,"Moreover, the entire test equipment will be the size of a microwave oven and deliver a result within minutes and thus also enable on-site testing, for example in retirement homes or at airports.",
16284,The rapid test is being developed by scientists from Universität Hamburg and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in close collaboration with the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and the technology transfer offices of the participating institutions.,
16285,"For the planned method, a sample is taken from the mouth, nose, or throat of the person to be examined.",
16286,"The liquid sample is placed on a newly developed plastic chip, inserted into a special read-out device, and tested on two different levels:",
16287,"First, a rapid screening for the presence of corona viruses is carried out by detecting and counting them individually; samples in which no viruses are found can be considered COVID-19 negative.",
16288,"If the test is positive, the sample can be further examined in a second step, for example by analyzing the RNA of the virus.",
16289,"“This type of reading could provide information about the patients viral load and would work even at very low concentrations, which is the key to detecting infections in early stages,” says Fernandez-Cuesta., An interdisciplinary team is working on the development of the test.",
16290,"Fernandez-Cuesta, who recently became Young Investigator Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter, and her research group, based at the new Hamburg Advanced Research Centre for Bioorganic Chemistry (HARBOR), combine experience in nanosciences and nanotechnology.",
16291,Franziska Esmek and another member of her team will develop the chips as well as virion and RNA detection.,
16292,"In recent years, the scientists have already developed a method for the detection and analysis of individual DNA molecules in real time.",
16293,These results were tested in biomedical samples and bacteriophages and form the basis of the project.,
16294,The team at DESY led by Prof. Dr. Ingrid-Maria Gregor and Dr. Sergio Diez will design and build the test station for portable and highly sensitive in-situ analysis.,
16295,"The researchers will start the work with the support of Universität Hamburg, the Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter, and DESY, in close collaboration with the Technology Transfer Office at Science City Bahrenfeld, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), and the Centre for Structural Systems Biology (CSSB).",
16296,"“In addition, we will continue to raise funds,” says Fernandez-Cuesta.",
16297,"“Because the technology is not limited to SARS-CoV-2, but can be easily adapted for the analysis of other viruses or microorganisms”.
",
16298,"The map from the “Book of routes and realms” was created over 1,000 years ago.",
16299,It shows the Persian Sea.,
16300,On the left is the African coast; on the right the Middle Eastern and Asian coast from the Gulf of Suez to southern India.,
16301,"The so-called Persian Sea includes the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and part of the Indian Ocean.",
16302,"The following landmarks are indicated: Because of its orientation, it is difficult for today’s users to find their way around this section of the historical map, which is over 1,000 years old.",
16303,Turning the map makes orientation easier.,
16304,The first Arabic description of the world using texts and maps was created in the 10th century.,
16305,"The maps are amazingly modern, partly because they left unknown areas empty rather than filling them with fictional beings and places, explains Dr. Nadja Danilenko, an Islamic studies researcher in the Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts.",
16306,"The coastal cities line up like pearls—for example, Aden, a port city in today’s Yemen, and Siraf, which lies further east and is described in the accompanying text as one of Persia’s richest cities.",
16307,"In Kitāb al-Masālik wa-al-Mamālik (Book of routes and realms), which was written over 1,000 years ago, each city is represented by a rectangle or colored circle.",
16308,"These colors and shapes are used throughout the book, which contains 21 maps in total: one world map and 20 regional maps.",
16309,“One of the work’s authors was a man named al-Iṣṭakhrī.,
16310,We know very little about him.,
16311,"However, he was seemingly far-traveled, because he always mentions that he has visited places himself.",
16312,"Perhaps he was a trader or an administrative official in the Islamic world, which—at that time—stretched from the Iberian Peninsula to present-day Pakistan,” explains Dr. Nadja Danilenko, who wrote her doctoral thesis on the book.",
16313,"It was probably copied multiple times immediately after its creation and, as was common then, carried from place to place in the luggage of traveling scholars.",
16314,"Copyists everywhere made additional copies for private and public libraries–for example, like those found at courts.",
16315,"The astonishingly modern appearance of the maps, which are over 1,000 years old, comes from the use of colors and forms throughout the book: once the reader understands the principle, orientation is easy.",
16316,It is also the result of the different scales used.,
16317,"“Even if the maps are not to scale, they show sections of the countries known at that time as if they had been taken with various zoom lenses.",
16318,"All the maps refer to each other, and it is always clear where the individual regions are located.",
16319,"Al-Iṣṭakhrī was thus primarily concerned with overview and orientation, similar to today’s maps,” says Danilenko.",
16320,"However, it is especially against the background of the open spaces that the information contained in the maps comes into its own.",
16321,The maps are particularly striking when compared with their medieval counterparts from the Western world or with later copies.,
16322,"“The book was copied into the 19th century, sometimes being modified and adapted to the spirit of the times,” explains Danilenko.",
16323,"In Understanding Written Artefacts, the Islamic studies researcher is examining manuscripts that were in circulation during the 16th century in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, today’s Istanbul.",
16324,"In the course of this work, she has also come across copies of the “Book of routes and realms”— including a multicolored copy from the 16th century in which not only a few cities but the entire Indus River has been lost to the African continent.",
16325,It is unknown why the geographical features on this 16th century map are less accurate than the original.,
16326,It is possible that the illustrator worked with a damaged version.,
16327,"Now cavorting in the Persian Sea are Jonah and the whale, here in the shape of a big fish.",
16328,"And from the African coast, the archangel Gabriel is handing clothing to the prophet.",
16329,"“Here, the illustrator has freely interpreted the maps and has cast aside al-Iṣṭakhrī’s main concerns.",
16330,"Whereas al-Iṣṭakhrī included historical and cultural details in the text in order to keep the maps clear, this illustrator used the free spaces like a canvas.",
16331,The illustrator placed cities and rivers based on aesthetic sensibility and added motifs that they associated with specific regions.,
16332,"By doing so, the illustrator enriched al-Iṣṭakhrī’s maps with new levels of meaning that were familiar to him from the visual culture of his time,” explains Danilenko.",
16333,For Jonah and the whale already appeared in a copy from the 15th century.,
16334,"“The multicolored copy from the 16th century shows how motifs circulated in the Ottoman capital and led to new interpretations of older material,” says Danilenko.",
16335,"She is also studying these types of cartographic transformations in Understanding Written Artefacts.
",
16336,"“Art comes from moments of beautifying, enhancing the aesthetic appeal, combined with the practice of observing,” says one of the two seminar leaders, Prof. Dr. Stephan Porombka.",
16337,"“Look at your desk in detail,” is one of the instructions for the desk research seminar.",
16338,"The 20 participants study a broad variety of disciplines, for example, German language studies, sign-language interpreting, or informatics.",
16339,The students are encouraged to examine and be conscious of their posture at their desks.,
16340,An additional task: creating a desk glossary Seminar leader Julian Farny is a lecturer for verbal communication at the Berlin University of the Arts.,
16341,"He works with the subjects of modern culture, reading everyday phenomena and cultural practices.",
16342,"Photo: Marvin Trimpop “Satellite photos” show the desks from above, and tell us a lot about the working practices of their owners.",
16343,"Working at a desk as an imaginary race: “the clock is ticking, the finish line is in sight,” wrote this student about his photo.",
16344,"This semester, visiting scholar Prof. Dr. Stephan Porombka and Julian Farny from the Berlin University of the Arts are enriching the subject range at Universität Hamburg with a very unusual seminar: together with their students, they are examining their desks.",
16345,Workplace studies are an established field of research in sociology.,
16346,We look at workplaces and ask how people work.,
16347,"How do they set themselves up, what do they need to be able to work properly?",
16348,These are important research questions.,
16349,"In our seminar, we look at the tables where we work, as landscapes in a constant state of change—made up of books, textbooks, papers, notes, pens, cables, and devices.",
16350,The students will create comprehensive journals of text and pictures that reflect their own working style.,
16351,They will also generally document how students in Hamburg are currently set up and how they work.,
16352,"The information is of interest for a range of disciplines, for psychologists as well as learning researchers, sociologists, anthropologists, or historians.",
16353,There will be things in the pictures that we don’t even notice that will astonish observers in 30 years.,
16354,They will work a little like a time capsule.,
16355,Absolutely.,
16356,Just the act of close observation is an art in itself.,
16357,"Students learn to transform the mundane into something special, and that is exactly what art does.",
16358,"It transforms everyday things, turning them into something special, a process of increasing aesthetic appeal which improves the everyday.",
16359,We always tell our students that they cannot do anything wrong.,
16360,"When they ask how to start with an artistic process like this, I say “you’re already there.",
16361,"Whenever you observe and reflect on what you see, you are in the process.”",
16362,It is insanely wonderful.,
16363,"The material is unlimited, and the students are the ones who provide it.",
16364,"Had I remained a scholar of German studies, I would have always had the same specific material, in my case, 19th century German literature.",
16365,"This material is limited, and students can only be given tasks to carry out within the bounds of my existing knowledge.",
16366,"In our seminar on desk research, the participants create something unique.",
16367,"Every week, they show us something very private, they open themselves up and work with their ideas.",
16368,"We, as their teachers, are always surprised with what they show us.",
16369,"We feel very lucky to receive such gifts, and that is fun!",
16370,"I think that the word ‘practical’ always triggers a wonderful reflex: “Finally, I can do something myself!”",
16371,Doing something practical was also a promise in this seminar that all the participants were excited about.,
16372,They were also allowed to pursue their research in whatever way they wished.,
16373,"We always say, “You are the researchers, develop what you think is the best research structure!”",
16374,"For many of them, that is something new, and it’s exciting.",
16375,It’s about providing key skills that go beyond a narrow field of expertise.,
16376,"Today, it is a lot to do with providing an education that has value in the market place, increasing ‘employability.’",
16377,"But it’s important to reach beyond our own boundaries, and this also teaches essential skills.",
16378,Studium Generale brings people from a range of disciplines together.,
16379,"They learn that their particular view of the world is just one of many possibilities, and they often come to exciting collaborations.",
16380,The idea is quite appealing.,
16381,Next semester I am holding an online lecture titled “Text—City—Text.”,
16382,"It deals with how one reads a city, what one writes about a city, or how one moves through a city in writing.",
16383,"In an accompanying seminar for Hamburg students, Julian Farny leads writing exercises to teach participants how to engage with their city and their environment.",
16384,"It is kind of a continuation of this seminar.
",
16385,“The map is the result of many years of work with incredibly complicated data.,
16386,"We are proud to have opened this new window on our Universe,” says Francesco de Gasperin.",
16387,Francesco de Gasperin is a junior professor at Universität Hamburg and a member of the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe.,
16388,He carries out research at the Hamburg Observatory.,
16389,"An international team of astronomers headed by Junior Professor Dr. Francesco de Gasperin, a researcher at the Hamburg Observatory and member of the Cluster of Excellence Quantum Universe at Universität Hamburg, has created the largest and clearest sky map in ultralow radio frequency.",
16390,"The map was published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics and shows more than 25,000 active massive black holes in distant galaxies.",
16391,"At first glance, the map looks like a picture of the constellations at night; however, it is based on data from the LOFAR radio telescope, which has been in operation for roughly 10 years, and shows the sky in radio frequency.",
16392,"At this frequency, stars are nearly invisible.",
16393,"Instead, massive black holes dominate the image.",
16394,"Using this map, astronomers try to discover celestial objects that send waves at a low radio frequency.",
16395,"These include, for example, diffuse gases in the vast space of the universe, fading plasma ejected by massive black holes, and exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system whose magnetic fields interact with their parent star.",
16396,"Although it is one of the largest of its kind, the published map covers only 2 percent of the sky.",
16397,It will still take several years to map the entire northern sky.,
16398,“The map is the result of many years of work with incredibly complicated data.,
16399,"We had to develop new strategies for converting radio signals into sky maps, and we are proud to have opened this new window on our universe,” says Francesco de Gasperin, researcher at the Hamburg Observatory and the article’s lead author.",
16400,"The radio waves captured by LOFAR, the basis for the published map, reach up to 6 meters.",
16401,This is equivalent to a frequency of roughly 50 megahertz.,
16402,These are the longest radio waves ever used to observe such a large area of the sky at these depths.,
16403,"Almost no research has been done in this area, because observations at low radio frequencies are difficult.",
16404,"The reason for this is the so-called ionosphere, a layer of free electrons surrounding Earth.",
16405,It is essentially a lens over the radio telescope.,
16406,"Thus, radio observations are comparable to trying to see the world above from the bottom of a pool.",
16407,"If you look up, the water bends the rays of light and distorts the view.",
16408,"To counteract the ionosphere’s effects, the researcher used super computers and developed new algorithms.",
16409,This made it possible to compensate for the disruptive impact every 4 seconds throughout a 256-hour observation period.,

",
16448,"To develop new biotechnological applications, researchers need to understand changes in proteins.",
16449,"A group from different institutions in Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld has now developed the “spitrobot,” a new, significantly simpler procedure to observe these reactions.",
16450,The research team has introduced the concept in the journal Nature Communications.,
16451,"The individual steps in protein reactions can be rendered visible using a procedure called “time-resolved crystallography,” in which pictures are taken at each phase and then put together to show the changes in protein structure from all perspectives.",
16452,"Previously, this procedure required direct access to particle accelerators and complex experimental conditions.",
16453,"Using the new spitrobot, samples can now be prepared in standard laboratories and analyzed using automated, established methods elsewhere.",
16454,"The spitrobot dramatically simplifies the entire sample-preparation process and can speed up, for example, basic research in the field of health.",
16455,"Using the newly developed device, protein crystals are affixed to a special carrier; they are then sprayed with a substrate solution, which causes a reaction—a technique that was also developed by the spitrobot team.",
16456,"Finally, quick cooling of the proteins in liquid nitrogen, or vitrification, essentially freezes and preserves the various stages of the reaction.",
16457,"These samples, which the spitrobot can create quickly and precisely in line with industrial standards, can then be evaluated at specialist institutions.",
16458,"Thus, the spitrobot separates sample preparation and data collecting, which is a significant advantage for most structural biologists.",
16459,"“The spitrobot will considerably accelerate the study of enzymatic mechanisms,” says Dr. Pedram Mehrabi from the Department of Physics at Universität Hamburg.",
16460,Mehrabi heads an Emmy Noether independent junior research group and is the first author of the article in Nature Communications.,
16461,“It enables non-specialists to conduct experiments that so far only experts have been able to conduct.,
16462,This should lead to a really difficult experiment having much broader application.”,
16463,"The procedure was developed by closely cooperating researchers from Universität Hamburg, the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD), and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Hamburg, all located in Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld, and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).",
16464,"“We created the spitrobot with a view to the typical structural biology lab,” explains Dr. Eike C. Schulz from the UKE.",
16465,"Schulz, Mehrabi, and Dr. Friedjof Tellkamp from Max Planck’s Scientific Support Unit developed the technology together.",
16466,"“This is why we strove for a multifaceted, robust, and simple solution that made it possible to work with both large and small crystals and to combine the simplest type of reaction with the timescales of most enzymes.”
",
16467,"For the second time, Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence has awarded fellowships to 4 outstanding early career researchers, among them is public health researcher Dr. Kathleen Gali.",
16468,She is investigating how smokers with cancer can be helped to quit.,
16469,"Every year 125,000 people in Germany die as a result of their tobacco consumption.",
16470,"Around a quarter of all adults smoke, with consequential costs to the healthcare system of €25 billion annually.",
16471,"In Germany, the influence of the tobacco industry on tobacco-related legislation is a major barrier to effective tobacco control policies.",
16472,Germany lags behind most other European countries on enacting comprehensive tobacco control measures despite there being public support for tobacco control measures such as smoking bans and tax increases on tobacco products among Germans.,
16473,"But: “The economic, social, and health burden of smoking can be prevented,” says Dr. Kathleen Gali, a U.S.-born postdoctoral researcher previously at Stanford University.",
16474,"For three years, beginning in August 2021, Dr. Gali will be funded as a Postdoctoral Fellow by the University of Excellence Hamburg.",
16475,"During this period, she will survey 1,600 smokers to learn about their attitudes and experiences with smoking cessation and to learn what smoking cessation methods they might be interested in.",
16476,She also wants to support the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf build its smoking cessation services to help patients quit.,
16477,"“The persistent use of tobacco among cancer patients is cause for concern,” says Dr. Gali.",
16478,"In Germany, 89 percent of lung cancer cases among men and 83 percent of lung cancer cases among women are traceable to smoking.",
16479,"“Continuing to smoke even after a diagnosis can make treatment more difficult, delay wound healing, and increase the risk that the cancer returns.",
16480,"Despite this, up to 50 percent of cancer patients continue to smoke during their treatment.”",
16481,"Currently, tobacco use by patients at the UKE is not systematically documented.",
16482,"By assessing and documenting tobacco use in medical charts, patients are more likely engage in cessation services, and therefore more likely to quit smoking.",
16483,"As part of her research, Dr. Gali wants to find out how tobacco treatment services can be integrated into the UKE’s operations.",
16484,"In her previous work at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, she discovered: “To ensure that programs like this work, you have to develop them together with stakeholders, including the people who are supposed to implement them.”",
16485,"This is why Dr. Gali, who has a background in psychology and public health, is planning to conduct also interviews with adults who smoke, patients with cancer who smoke, and experts in addiction and tobacco use in Germany, including clinicians who care for patients with cancer.",
16486,"The fellowship’s materials budget of €20,000 will cover Dr. Gali’s project costs, including recruitment efforts and equipment.",
16487,"At Universität Hamburg, Dr. Gali is conducting her research within the area of Health Economics, one of the University’s five emerging fields.",
16488,"Awarding postdoctoral fellowships fortifies these important areas, which should give rise to future clusters of excellence.",
16489,"Furthermore, the fellowships lend support to outstanding early career researchers from both Germany and abroad who wish to prepare for their next career steps, e.g., as the leader of an early career research group or as a junior professor.",

16492,The Linothorax student research group received funding for 2019.,
16493,The students are trying to reconstruct a linothorax as these were used in antiquity.,
16494,Martin Horst is basing his work on an historical model in the Plaster Cast Collection at Universität Hamburg.,
16495,"The ancient armor consisted of handwoven linen, but for the reconstruction, modern linen can also be used.",
16496,The students are gluing 16 layers on top of each other with an adhesive consisting of animal remains.,
16497,They want to see how well this kind of protection can resist an arrow or lance.,
16498,"Theory requires practice, and voluntary research groups are a good opportunity to put knowledge to the test.",
16499,"Students are developing apps for shuttle buses, revitalizing the medicinal garden at the Institute of Pharmacy, and reconstructing an ancient linothorax, which is a type of upper body armor.",
16500,The application deadline for the 2020 funding round is 31 July 2020.,
16501,"A total of €100,000 is available from Excellence Strategy funds, with a maximum of €10,000 per project.",
16502,The warrior is squatting in a strange position: he rests his bodyweight on his right foot while stretching his left leg and arm forward.,
16503,"“He’s missing his bow,” explains Martin Horst, who majors in ancient history and has already completed his minor in archeology.",
16504,"However, he is more interested in the clothes worn by the Hercules statue from the fifth century BC than he is in the archer’s lost bow.",
16505,"“We do not know very much about the linothorax, which were widely worn then,” says the student as he analyzes the ancient armor in the University’s Plaster Cast Collection.",
16506,"“We know it from the literature, vase images, and sculptures like this, but only a single, tiny fragment has survived.”",
16507,What we know is that the linothorax was roughly a centimeter thick and composed of several layers of fabric glued together using a hardening paste.,
16508,The linen was made of flax.,
16509,"Presumably, the wives or slaves of the Greek warriors spun the yarn and wove the fabric.",
16510,"As the linothorax did not have to be produced by specialists, they were presumably not only lighter and more comfortable but also cheaper than bronze armor.",
16511,"“We are still looking for the right adhesive,” says Justine Diemke, who is also part of the student research group reconstructing the linothorax.",
16512,"“Initially, we used paste made of linseed—that is, flaxseed.",
16513,But that also didn’t work; it was too easy to pull apart the layers again.”,
16514,"Thus, the students are now experimenting with adhesive made of hare and rabbit fur.",
16515,It is already known that this was used in antiquity.,
16516,"“We are evaluating historical sources and basing our work on the proven facts,” says Martin Horst about their search for the right adhesive—and for their approach to experimental archeology in general.",
16517,He says it is also important to take the Greeks’ battle styles into account.,
16518,"What movements did the warriors have to make, and which body parts were exposed?",
16519,"Martin Horst, in the first, half-finished linothorax, stands next to his historical role model.",
16520,"The original statue is housed in a museum in Munich, but for Martin Horst’s purposes, the plaster cast is more than sufficient.",
16521,"He tests the freedom of movement, the straps, and the armholes and examines the length of the linothorax worn by the archer.",
16522,“Thin strips of fabric on the lower seam protect the lower body.,
16523,"We still don’t know how they were connected to the breast armor,” Horst wonders.",
16524,He also needs to ask what the linothorax had to withstand.,
16525,"Should it protect its wearer against the thrust of a sword, a swiftly approaching arrow, or a lance hurled from the middle distance?",
16526,"“We want to try all of that out,” explain Justine Diemke and Martin Horst.",
16527,"In the Linothorax project, they also want to check whether adhesive made of animal remains really formed the ideal basis or whether another, as-yet-unknown agent may be more effective.

16567,This was also on display at the Arts & Science exhibition mounted by the cluster of excellence at Hamburg’s city hall.,
16568,Since 2019 Universität Hamburg has been a University of Excellence.,
16569,"A year earlier, 4 clusters of excellence received grants.",
16570,What has been accomplished since then and how has the funding been used?,
16571,The Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter talks about its previous research and funding in the photon and nanosciences.,
16572,"Path-breaking research findings, new buildings for teaching and research, tailor-made programs for outstanding researchers, successful exhibitions: the groundwork for these achievements was already laid in the prior Cluster of Excellence The Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging.",
16573,"From 2012 to 2018, the cluster focused on the imaging of the ultrafast movements of molecules, atoms, and electrons.",
16574,In 2018 the Excellence Commission decided that this research on the properties of matter needed to continue.,
16575,"The cluster’s successor, CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter, is now looking at functionalities: the larger and more complex chemical and physical systems become, the more new properties they develop.",
16576,"Take, for example, superconductivity, which is the ability to conduct electricity without energy loss.",
16577,The physics and chemistry researchers involved in the project want to understand these properties so that they can one day steer them.,
16578,There are 160 researchers employed directly with the cluster.,
16579,Another 170 members of various research groups lend support.,
16580,"The researchers hail from Universität Hamburg, the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD), the European XFEL GmbH, and DESY.",
16581,The cluster has already produced over 600 publications.,
16582,"Of these, 46 alone can be found in highly prestigious magazines in the Nature group and the scientific journal Science.",
16583,"With 150 publications per year, the number of publications exceeds that of the preceding cluster.",
16584,"One recently published work exemplifies the cluster’s interdisciplinary and inter-institutional pioneering work: First, researchers from MPSD and DESY developed a theory for an innovative procedure to depict molecules.",
16585,This procedures uses the quantum nature of X-Ray light.,
16586,"Then a group that included members of Universität Hamburg confirmed the theory in an experiment at European XFEL, thus opening up entirely new research approaches.",
16587,"These links between theory and experimentation can be found in all of the cluster’s projects: quantum physics and quantum optics, the physics of condensed matter, ultrafast physics, ultrafast X-Ray imaging, X-Ray physics, nanophysics, and bio-imaging.",
16588,"Thanks to a series of new appointments, the cluster is also able to strengthen or forge new areas in theoretical physics, nanochemistry, and quantum technologies.",
16589,"The work in the cluster has also given rise to a series of successful grant requests, especially in quantum research and quantum computing—for example, €25 million from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research for the Rymax-One project.",
16590,Doctoral and early career researchers form a central pillar of the cluster’s success.,
16591,"Every year, the Cluster of Excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter hires up to 42 new doctoral and postdoctoral researchers.",
16592,More than 80 percent of the funding flows into the training of young researchers.,
16593,The cluster even has its own funding concept for outstanding young researchers: the goal of the Young Investigator Group Leader Program is to provide the best support possible to highly talented doctoral and early career researchers and to guide them on their way to a professorship or leadership position.,
16594,"Dr. Thore Posske, for example, recently received a €1.5 million Starting Grant from the European Research Council for his project QUANTWIST.",

16626,Two teachers from different subject areas cooperated on the development of an innovative learning format for the topic of sustainability.,
16627,"Here, we introduce one of the projects.",
16628,"“Changing places, migrating, being mobile—since the dawn of humanity this has been the daily lived experience for many people and has shaped a very large part of human history, while staying put is really the exception.",
16629,"Accordingly, migration plays an important role in art and literature, science, and historical accounts,” says Dr. Gilberto Rescher, sociologist and expert on Latin America at Universität Hamburg.",
16630,"Together with Thorsten Logge, professor of public history, he has developed a teaching format for the Studium General that enables students to take a critical look at how migration is handled in museums.",
16631,"“Our students come from very different subject areas, for example, education, English studies, or business administration,” explains Rescher.",
16632,“Many have never considered the fact that museums also serve particular narratives.,
16633,"Simply the selection of objects or the way they are displayed, however, reflect particular views, social discourse, or special interests.",
16634,Our seminar is designed to enable students to recognize this.”,
16635,"Virtual field trips to exhibitions in 4 museums in countries known for immigration, including New York’s Tenement Museum, the Museu Afro Brasil, the Museu da Imigração in São Paulo, and the Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney, form the seminar’s core.",
16636,"Museum staff at these institutions have filmed digital guided tours specifically for this seminar, which they can then discuss online with students in Hamburg.",
16637,"The seminar focuses on narratives and discourse and how the United States, Brazil, and Australia as nations have developed on the basis of their various immigration populations.",
16638,"All 3 countries have superficial national myths according to which they are melting pots, wealth is possible for everyone, and there is fundamental equal opportunity.",
16639,“Yet it is evident that success stories make better narratives than the stories of marginalized groups assigned to underprivileged positions.,
16640,"This is why we are taking a special look at whether and how the migration of ethnic minorities, women, or rural peoples is handled,” says Rescher.",
16641,Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence is funding teaching tandems as part of efforts to expand the Studium Generale.,

16645,"To celebrate Universität Hamburg’s 100th anniversary, the city is hosting a “summer of knowledge” at Ratshausmarkt, in front of Hamburg’s City Hall, from 20 to 23 June.",
16646,"Other Hamburg universities and research institutions, as well as over 70 researchers from Universität Hamburg, will be joining the festivities.",
16647,"The Ministry of Science, Research and Equalities is hosting the “summer of knowledge” festivities (in German: Sommer des Wissens) .",
16648,"For 4 days, Rathausmarkt, the square in front of Hamburg’s centrally located City Hall, will become a campus with a stage and futuristic igloo-like exhibition tents.",
16649,"Universität Hamburg will be offering on-site talks, experiments, and workshops.",
16650,All Hamburg residents and members of the University are invited to attend!,
16651,The festival is free.,
16652,"Universität Hamburg will be hosting 80 activities “Important birthdays are celebrated with friends: Approximately 40 universities and academic institutions will celebrate the ‘summer of knowledge’ for Universität Hamburg’s 100th anniversary at Rathausmark,” said the University’s president, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.",
16653,Dieter Lenzen.,
16654,"“I am looking forward to the exciting program and would like to thank the Ministry of Science, Research and Equalities for organizing this special event—and, of course, everyone taking part!”",
16655,Over 70 experts from Universität Hamburg will be presenting their research.,
16656,"In total, Universität Hamburg will be hosting roughly 80 activities throughout the 4 days, making it one of the event’s major contributors.",
16657,"Elementary particles and hidden biological weapons Universität Hamburg is offering a rich, exciting program: weather balloons will be launched into the skies, research objects with fascinating backgrounds will be presented, and scientists will explain how elementary particles were discovered and science helped uncover secret biological weapons.",
16658,"There will be 4 large centers with special themes: Center 1: Workshop for the future In the workshop for the future, we will spend 4 days looking at the most pressing questions of our time.",
16659,"We will be hosting discussions and performing experiments related to the environment, mobility, politics, and society.",
16660,"For example, visitors will be able to monitor the weather live in a mobile weather observatory provided by Universität Hamburg’s Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN).",
16661,"Center 2: Hi-tech lab In the hi-tech lab, scientists will be presenting the most recent developments in the natural sciences and technology.",
16662,"For example, visitors can make their own films using super time-lapse technology using a high-speed camera provided by the Cluster of Excellence Center for Ultrafast Imaging (CUI).",
16663,"Center 3: Cultural pavilion In the cultural pavilion, visitors can explore cultural studies and the humanities and gain insights into art, music, theater, design, and architecture.",
16664,The staff of the Center for the Study of Manuscripts will explain how research is making it possible to once again render destroyed or illegible manuscripts visible.,
16665,Center 4: Health center The health center will provide a glimpse into medical research being conducted in Hamburg.,
16666,"For example, visitors can take part in a quiz on the German health system hosted by the Hamburg Center for Health Economics (HCHE) or create their own medical wax models.",
16667,Program activities for children and school classes Many of the activities are suitable for or cater specifically to children.,
16668,"For example, younger visitors can analyze the bones of a real marine dinosaur, discover stars and planets, or use a climate model to simulate what happens when a forest is cleared or a factory is shut down.",
16669,"Universität Hamburg is also offering a special program for school classes: for example, school students can learn about trips with the research vessel Vulkan, talk to experts about why there are wars, or test their knowledge of the universe.
",
16670,An international research team with participation of Universität Hamburg has developed an index that can be used to assess the condition of the Baltic Sea.,
16671,But how does this Baltic Health Index (BHI) work?,
16672,And which grade does the Baltic Sea currently achieve?,
16673,Researchers assessing the health of oceans used to involve simply examining the components of an ecosystem without asking what value these components bring to society.,
16674,"But in recent years oceanographers have begun to examine the status of oceans by asking what ecosystem sectors are affected by people, and what ecosystem sectors do people most value.",
16675,"Examining this human-nature interaction is important when designing modern ocean resource management policies (e.g. Policies for ocean conservation, food production, and recreation).",
16676,It led to the first Ocean Health Index (OHI) performed by US researchers in 2012.,
16677,Now a similar survey focusing on the Baltic Sea shows that its ecosystem needs to improve drastically.,
16678,The study has been published in the journal People and Nature and is available to view on it’s own website.,
16679,Prof. Dr. Christian Möllmann from the Institute of Marine Ecosystem and Fisheries Science at the University of Hamburg examined the health of the Baltic Sea’s fish stocks in the study.,
16680,"He notes that one of the unique aspects of the study was including the human element of the study, to make it more holistic.",
16681,"“The idea was to make an assessment that covers all the sectors and also the social ecological linkages,” he said.",
16682,"Using the OHI as a framework, the paper’s authors used regularly updated environmental, ecological and social datasets to assess the health of the Baltic Sea.",
16683,"These datasets included information on water cleanliness, biodiversity and tourism, for example.",
16684,Prof. Möllmann focused on the ‘sustainable fishing’ sector; this involved checking if the amount of fish species caught exceeded the threshold that is considered sustainable.,
16685,"“Basically, the whole index is a data collection exercise.",
16686,"And then you have to make decisions on what the thresholds are,” he said.",
16687,The resulting index unfortunately shows partly an unhealthy relationship between ecosystems and social systems of the Baltic Sea.,
16688,The Baltic Sea overall scored a 76/100 in terms of health.,
16689,"The worst performing sectors were water contamination, excess algae and plant matter (eurtophication) and the sea’s ability to store carbon.",
16690,"The results are mixed, though there’s been some small improvements.",
16691,"For example, the Bothnian Bay and Kiel Bay scored high in water quality.",
16692,"However, the stocks of cod, which Prof Möllmann studied scored low for the entire Baltic Sea region.",
16693,"Nearly all the areas nevertheless also showed signs of improvement, pointing to a healthier Baltic Sea in the next few years.",
16694,"“In the end, it shows that [the Baltic Sea] is maybe better than expected, but theres still room for improvement,” said Prof. Möllmann., While it is not perfect, Prof. Möllmann says the BHI provides policymakers and oceanographers a way to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of how the Baltic Sea is managed.",
16695,"The next steps for the authors are to improve the assessment by updating its methodology and adding new data, said Prof. Möllmann.",
16696,"For now Prof. Möllmann is using the data from the index for the “balt_ADAPT” project, which is developing a climate change adaptation strategy for the Baltic Sea region.",
16697,"“We want to link the work from the index project to our project, so that we can make better estimates for the western Baltic,” he said.
",
16698,Tensions continue to grow between North Korea and the United States and there is no resolution in sight.,
16699,"In this interview, physicist and peace researcher Prof. Dr. Götz Neuneck talks about the dangers of and potential solutions to the conflict with North Korea.",
16700,"Peace and conflict researchers can analyze conflict situations more precisely, posit models for international negotiations, and prepare concrete recommendations for conflict resolution.",
16701,"As a physicist, I ostensibly do research on nuclear weapons and missile capability.",
16702,"To do that, you need to understand how nuclear weapons can be built and what capabilities countries have in the future based on their missile tests.",
16703,"I am also the German representative to the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs, which has taken place annually since 1957.",
16704,"Named after the first meeting place in Pugwash, Canada, this is an international conference at which researchers discuss the dangers of the atomic age and how to avoid them.",
16705,The Pugwash Organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 and it has repeatedly opened channels to communication with North Korea.,
16706,Experts have long been saying that North Korea is the Cuban Missile Crisis in slow motion.,
16707,"Since the last underground nuclear tests and the last two missile tests, North Korea seems determined to build up its nuclear deterrent potential.",
16708,"In the next five years, the tested missiles could conceivably carry nuclear warheads all the way to the United States.",
16709,This would cross the United States’ “red line.”,
16710,Trump’s contradictory rhetoric neither alleviates nor solves the problem and it doesn’t follow any clear policy.,
16711,Three aircraft carriers in the US Navy fleet are now conducting military exercises and the show of force continues to grow.,
16712,One can only hope that neither side loses its head.,
16713,"An overreaction, an accident, or a misunderstanding can, indeed, result in dangerous escalation.",
16714,"A war in the region would have immediate consequences for South Korea, China, or Japan.",
16715,"On the the other hand, no one truly wants a war that even with conventional forces would lead to countless deaths in the region.",
16716,"The special thing about this is undoubtedly the existence of nuclear weapons; the old ideological separation of Korea into North and South; the regional situation in Korea and Japan; and the global situation, for example in the United States, China, and Russia.",
16717,"Moreover, the fact that the brutal Korean War at the beginning of the 1950s marked the dawn of the Cold War and to date no acceptable solution to Korea has been found.",
16718,The North Korean regime strikes many people as strange but it rests on the development of the East-West confrontation.,
16719,"The regime is supported primarily by its military, uses Stalinist rhetoric, and keeps its own starving population under lock and key.",
16720,"Propaganda, brain-washing, and re-education are the people’s daily bread.",
16721,"Even China, North Korea’s immediate ally, has little influence on the government.",
16722,Kim Kong Un has not left the country or greeted other national leaders.,
16723,North Korea is a black hole in the global age.,
16724,"By Western standards, it’s bizarre.",
16725,We need to seek dialog.,
16726,"North Korea, of course, would like political and economic guarantees.",
16727,"Furthermore, China and neighboring states need to be involved.",
16728,One of Korea’s demands is that the military exercises cease.,
16729,This is one way for both sides to ease the conflict and lay the cornerstones for negotiations.,
16730,"But it won’t be easy because North Korea wants to keep its nuclear arsenal, which it sees as a guarantee for the regime’s survival.

16731,"The Low Frequency Array, also known as LOFAR, is an innovative digital radio telescope based in The Netherlands and spanning 6 European countries.",
16732,Universität Hamburg and the University of Bielefeld also have a LOFAR receiving station in Norderstedt.,
16733,"In our video, Prof. Dr. Marcus Brüggen and doctoral candidate Amanda Wilber provide a glimpse into LOFAR and explain how they use it for research.",
16734,LOFAR is the first of a new generation of radio telescopes.,
16735,"It is used in the frequency range between ~10 MHz and ~240 MHz, a range that has not been widely researched so far.",
16736,"Under the aegis of Prof. Dr Marcus Brüggen, the radio astronomy group at the Hamburg Observatory uses LOFAR extensively to investigate galaxy clusters.
",
16737,"Universität Hamburg’s international network is continuing to grow: approximately 50 members of Universität Hamburg and the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen met to talk about future, more comprehensive collaboration.",
16738,"There are already numerous academic contacts between the two universities, and they are now looking to identify additional shared research areas.",
16739,"The areas of data science, infection research, marketing, health economics, sustainability, and astrophysics were identified as particularly promising.",
16740,"Both universities will provide approximately €15,000 per year for exchange and the development of new ideas between researchers.",
16741,"Since 2012, Universität Hamburg’s internationalization strategy has included the development of a strategic network of partnerships with international higher education institutions.",
16742,"The University of Groningen is the third cooperation partner in Europe for Universität Hamburg, after Lund University, and the University of Strasbourg.",
16743,"Partnerships include student exchanges, joint teaching and exchange formats, and research projects, particularly in Universität Hamburg’s profile areas.",
16744,"Founded in 1614, the Rijkuniversiteit Groningen is one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands, and the third largest, with approximately 30,000 students studying in 11 faculties.",
16745,"The university offers 90 English-language master’s degrees and 36 English-language bachelor’s degrees, demonstrating its commitment to internationalization.",
16746,"Prof. Dr. Ben Feringa, who won the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2016 is among their renowned researchers, and alumni include the former President of the of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg.",
16747,The cities of Hamburg and Groningen also maintain a close relationship.,
16748,"The cooperation agreement, which was extended in April 2019, lists the topics of renewable energy, scholarship and research, urban development, mobility, and health.
",
16749,"In the most recent international University Impact Ranking conducted by Times Higher Education (THE), Universität Hamburg has ranked 60th.",
16750,"Above all, the University has been recognized for implementing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals in exemplary fashion.",
16751,"Every year the British magazine for higher education, Times Higher Education (THE), ranks universities worldwide according to their reputations for research and teaching.",
16752,"Now, for the first time, the THE has ranked international universities according to the impact of their scholarly and scientific activities on the general public.",
16753,"A major criterion is the university’s impact on society, based on how successfully it has implemented the UN’s Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).",
16754,More than 450 universities from over 75 countries took part in the University Impact Ranking.,
16755,"Universität Hamburg ranked among the world’s best 60 universities for Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3), with a ranking of 51, and for Quality Education (SDG 4), with a ranking of 29.",
16756,"The University made a special impression in the areas of Quality Education, Health and Well-Being, and Gender Equality.",
16757,"What do Professor Dr. Alexander Bassen from the Center for a Sustainable University (KNU) and Dr. Angelika Paschke-Kratzin, the equal opportunity commissioner, think?",
16758,We are good at transporting substance for the term “sustainable development.”,
16759,"For example, for all 17 SDGs, we have found researchers to act as patrons.",
16760,"Furthermore, the University has created an online map depicting all sustainability projects in research, teaching, the administration, or infrastructure that have a connection to one or more of the SDGs.",
16761,"And at the annual Action Days for Sustainability, the SDGs provide the framework so that it is easier to understand the sheer breadth of sustainability at the University.",
16762,Gender equality is a cross-cutting issue with a long-established tradition at the University.,
16763,"Among other things, this has resulted in an academic staff with 34% women professors—a percentage far above the average.",
16764,The first guidelines on gender equality at Universität Hamburg go back more than 34 years.,
16765,"Since then, they have been repeatedly updated and expanded and we have analyzed their impact.",
16766,"In 2015, our guidelines to promote equal opportunities for women became a general equal opportunity guideline.",
16767,"This has since been supplemented by a centralized equal opportunity plan and, most recently, by a diversity plan.",
16768,Not only has the University structured its equal opportunity work; it also offers over 100 specific equal opportunity measures.,
16769,"Since 2018, there has been a separate database for these which provides a targeted overview of the measures.
",
16770,"[Following last years successful Particles, Strings and Cosmology summer school pilot program, 3 new international programs on climate change, health economics, and physics will be offered this upcoming summer.",
16771,"The goal is to attract gifted young people from all over the world to Hamburg, where they will work for 4 weeks alongside top-tier researchers from the University while also learning more about the city and German culture.",
16772,", The coordinating faculties and the Department of International Affairs are offering the summer school programs to promote international exchange among young researchers.",
16773,This should also strengthen strategic university partnerships because students from partner universities can take advantage of special conditions to attend courses.,
16774,We know from last year\s pilot project that our course offers are very attractive internationally.,
16775,"Both instructors and participants from all over the world showed great commitment and enthusiasm, said Olga Wagner, the program\s coordinator in the Department of International Affairs.",
16776,Participant feedback from Summer School 2017 was very positive.,
16777,I really enjoyed aspects of my studies here that I did not at my own university.,
16778,Some of my friends were jealous that I was able to take part in the summer school program.,
16779,"And I think they should definitely attend next year, said Timothy Gary Carolus from South Africa\s",
16780,Stellenbosch University.,
16781,All of the instructors were very open to discussion and questions.,
16782,That was really great.,
16783,"It was a very well-rounded program, academically and culturally, said Anneke Erasmus, also from Stellenbosch University.",
16784,"Academic staff from the social sciences and humanities offer courses on academic, cultural, and regional topics.",
16785,"An integral part of the summer school program, these courses not only highlight Hamburg as hub of university studies and research; they also provide a glimpse into German culture and the German academic system.",
16786,A German language course and extracurricular activities such as trips to Berlin and Lübeck round off the program.,
16787,"This year 3 thematic areas—Particles, Strings and Cosmology; Health Economics; and Climate Change—correspond to key research areas of the University.",
16788,The project is now being developed following last years successful pilot program.,
16789,"In the upcoming years the model will be expanded to include topics from all faculties.]
",
16790,Currently 38 projects in all subject areas: The new range of online projects covers the entire spectrum of coronavirus research at Universität Hamburg.,
16791,"All are welcome to inform themselves about the projects, their results, and promising ideas.",
16792,Below we introduce 3 examples.,
16793,"The evaluation of current coronavirus measures, vaccination acceptance, or satisfaction with work or the government—the citizenry’s opinions on various aspects of the pandemic have repeatedly changed in the last year.",
16794,The European COvid Survey (ECOS) conducted by the Hamburg Center for Health Economics (HCHE) provides a detailed look at the concerns and expectations of Europeans.,
16795,"The representative study conducted jointly with 3 other universities has surveyed 7,000 people in 7 European countries every 2 months since April 2020.",
16796,Are they complying with political decisions such as the contact restrictions?,
16797,What are their financial and economic concerns?,
16798,"The survey, with roughly 100 questions, covers changes throughout the highly dynamic course of the coronavirus pandemic.",
16799,The findings will be published in journals and made available to the public.,
16800,"For example, members of the public can find current numbers at the HCHE Corona Dashboard.",
16801,Both the HCHE Research Results Live and HCHE Research Seminar series also offer an opportunity for knowledge exchange.,
16802,"The coronarchiv, a public history project, was launched in March 2020 for German and English-speaking users.",
16803,It provides members of the public with a forum to report on and document their everyday experiences throughout the pandemic.,
16804,This is an opportunity that the team under Dr. Gilberto Rescher from the Institute of Romance Languages and Literature is now also offering to people from Latin America.,
16805,"“Due to the especially serious course of the pandemic there, they are strongly affected by everyday changes,” says Rescher.",
16806,"In pictures, short texts, videos, and other media, Spanish and Portuguese speakers from all over the world can take part in the project.",
16807,"“We are making it possible to compare the everyday experiences of the pandemic,” explains the research associate in the field of Latin American studies.",
16808,"For example, recent history may have exposed some people in these societies to more unpredictable situations or crises than the people in Germany.",
16809,"“People in Latin America are to some extent used to developing everyday strategies despite problems and suffering,” says Rescher.",
16810,"In the upcoming projects, he explains, a global perspective on the basis of the contributions to the various versions of the coronarchiv can be used to study the theoretical understanding of social processes in the coronavirus pandemic and their consequences.",
16811,"While there are now several different vaccines against the corona virus, the development of anti-viral drugs are also being studied.",
16812,An important approach to treatment is preventing the proliferation of the virus in the body.,
16813,But how does the SARS-CoV-2 virus actually proliferate,
16814,and how can it be stopped?,
16815,Prof. Dr. Chris Meier and Dr. Johanna Hüchting from the research area of organic chemistry at Universität Hamburg are both researching the topic.,
16816,"“For us, the mutations that keep arising during the proliferation process in the cells is especially interesting,” says Huchting.",
16817,The researchers believe that an accelerated mutation process could render the virus harmless.,
16818,"“We are studying agents that lead to these kind of mutations,” says Meier.",
16819,"For one study conducted with a research group from the French Aix-Marseille University, sample substances were created and subsequently evaluated.",
16820,"“We found out that SARS-CoV-2 did, in fact, proliferate less thanks to the accelerated mutations and was essentially stopped,” explains the chemistry expert.",
16821,"The most promising anti-viral agent, which was derived from the well-known flu medication Favipiravir (brand name: Avigan), now needs to undergo further study.
",
16822,"Universität Hamburg has just signed a trilateral joint PhD agreement with Macquarie University (MQ) from Sydney, Australia, and Fudan University (FU) from Shanghai in China.",
16823,This is the first agreement of its kind to be signed with a Chinese university.,
16824,Universität Hamburg has been running a bilateral doctoral program since 2012 with Macquarie University.,
16825,The joint PhD agreement was signed as part of a trilateral conference held between the partners from 10–12 September 2018 at Universität Hamburg.,
16826,"The network aims to give PhD students an opportunity to benefit from the expertise of the three universities, and complete their doctoral studies as part of a joint PhD program.",
16827,Students are registered at all three universities and supervised by teaching staff from all partner universities.,
16828,The program is open to students of all disciplines.,
16829,The universities have been part of a trilateral strategic partnership since 2014.,
16830,"It is one of the cornerstones of Universität Hamburg’s internationalization strategy, aiming for sustainable partnerships and long-term collaborations in research and education.",
16831,"The partnership encompasses 21 specialist projects, 12 of which are funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Strategic Partnerships and Thematic Networks program.",
16832,"The trilateral conference marked the end of the first DAAD funding phase in December 2018, which also serves as the kick-off point for the second round of funding from January 2019.",
16833,"The goal of the second phase is to strengthen and augment this collaboration, for ongoing cooperation beyond the DAAD funding phase.",
16834,"The trilateral partnership has continued to develop over the funding period, and now serves as a model for other partnerships.",
16835,"Professors, scholars, administrative staff and early career researchers from the three universities participated in the conference, along with representatives from the DAAD as the funding body.",
16836,"The delegations were led by the President of Macquarie University, Prof. Bruce Dowton MD and the Vice-president of Fudan University, Prof. Dr Chen Zhimin.

16837,"With one year less of Gymnasium, German high school students are now younger on average when starting university.",
16838,"According to the Federal Statistics Office, more and more first-year students are minors when they begin their studies.",
16839,"Alissa D., however, is probably one of the youngest.",
16840,"At 16, she is studying foodstuffs chemistry and is currently Universität Hamburg’s youngest student.",
16841,“Amazing!,
16842,How did you manage that?”,
16843,This is the question most people ask Alissa as soon as they hear that she is already studying at a university.,
16844,"“It just happened that way,” says the young student shrugging her shoulders.",
16845,It was already unusual when she started school just 3 months after her 5th birthday.,
16846,And it was more so that she was bumped up to 2nd grade just 2 weeks later.,
16847,"At 10, she skipped 7th grade and, just shy of 15, she found herself completing written Abitur exams.",
16848,Her kindergarten teachers had already suspected their 3-year-old charge might be gifted.,
16849,“My mother didn’t know exactly what that meant.,
16850,"As far as she was concerned, I was completely normal,” says Alissa.",
16851,"At the standard school entrance examination when she was 4, a psychologist confirmed that she was highly gifted and strongly recommended putting Alissa in school early.",
16852,Her decision to begin university study was influenced by the fact that there were few alternatives.,
16853,At 15 Alissa was too young to go abroad after completing her Abitur or to begin professional training.,
16854,"She did not want to take a one-year break, either, so she decided to study foodstuffs chemistry.",
16855,“Chemistry always interested me at school.,
16856,"And I definitely wanted to do something practical,” she said.",
16857,The greatest challenge at the start of her studies in Winter Semester 2016/2017 was the level of university work in organic chemistry.,
16858,“At the beginning I really had to cram!”,
16859,A new experience for the young student.,
16860,"Gnerally, however, Alissa still does not have to study too hard to get good grades.",
16861,"On a typical day, Alissa leaves the house around 7 am, attends her first lecture around 8 am, conducts lab experiments from noon to 6 pm, and then takes care of her two horses before heading home around 10 pm.",
16862,She admits that it can all be a bit strenuous.,
16863,"Nonetheless, she doesn’t miss the carefree life of the average 16-year-old.",
16864,“I don’t know if they have it any better.,
16865,"When I see how much my peers have to study for school, I realize that I have more time than they do, especially in the semester breaks.”",
16866,Her cats and horses also help relieve stress.,
16867,"“When I ride, I have a physical outlet and can be my age so that I don’t always have to be the smart or studious one.”",
16868,"At school, her classmates always thought it was exciting to have a much younger girl in their class.",
16869,The only envy she encountered was from a few parents when Alissa got better grades with less effort than their own gifted children.,
16870,"At this point, most people don’t notice the age difference.",
16871,"For example, the participants of this year’s preparatory math course did not know that their tutor was only 16.",
16872,Her age is only an issue in legal matters.,
16873,"“At 15, for example, I am not allowed to use a lighter, but it’s okay for me to use the Bunsen burner!”",
16874,she says laughing.,
16875,"If Alissa graduates in the regular period of study, she will have a bachelor’s at 18 and a master’s at 20.",
16876,She doesnt know what she wants to do after that.,
16877,"One thing is clear, however: she doesn’t want to finish faster.",
16878,She’d prefer to take a relaxed approach.,
16879,"“And if I fail now and then, I still have a few years ahead of me.”",
16880,"]
",
16881,"Every year, thousands of students earn their degree here.",
16882,Hundreds of doctorates are also awarded.,
16883,And the career options available after that are many and diverse.,
16884,"In this series, alumni from various faculties talk about what they learned at Universität Hamburg and what advice they have for students.",
16885,"This time, we highlight 5 alumni from the Faculty of Education.
",
16886,Universität Hamburg places great value on the development of international relations.,
16887,"Thus, it has now expanded its partnership with Kyoto University in Japan.",
16888,The presidents of both universities signed the cooperation contract today in an online conference.,
16889,"Alongside the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University is one of the country’s foremost universities and, with 11 Nobel laureates to date, also one of the most respected worldwide.",
16890,Kyoto University and Universität Hamburg have had a cooperation contract since 2017; the new agreement will strengthen and deepen existing ties.,
16891,"Among other things, the universities plan to focus on the following areas: criminal law, neurobiology, quantum physics, climate research, ecology, logistics, manuscript research, sociology, and political science.",
16892,"Following several visits and symposia in Hamburg and Kyoto in the past several years, the contract was initially supposed to be signed at another visit in Kyoto.",
16893,"Due to the corona pandemic, the festive moment had to take place digitally.",
16894,“What a joy to take this final step today towards formally sealing our partnership!”,
16895,exclaimed Prof.,
16896,Dr. Dr. h.c.,
16897,"Dieter Lenzen, president of Universität Hamburg.",
16898,"“I thank everyone involved and am full of hope for the future of our cooperation with the best Japanese university, Kyoto University.",
16899,I wish all of our colleagues the best in difficult times that we will master together.”,
16900,"Kyoto University is a public university with around 23,000 students and 2,800 academic staff.",
16901,The university was founded in 1897.,
16902,This makes it Japan’s second-oldest university.,
16903,Universität Hamburg is one of its 5 strategic partners in the world to date.,
16904,"As part of its internationalization strategy, Universität Hamburg has already been expanding its network of international higher education partners since 2012.",
16905,"As a flagship university, a concept that facilitated its denomination as a “University of Excellence,” internationalization plays a major role.
",
16906,"Every year, thousands of students earn their degree here.",
16907,Hundreds of doctorates are also awarded.,
16908,And the career options available after that are many and diverse.,
16909,"In this series, alumni from various faculties talk about what they learned at Universität Hamburg and what advice they have for students.",
16910,"This time, 4 alumni of the Faculty of Psychology and Human Movement Science offer their thoughts.
",
16911,The UN Climate Change Conference (COP23) began Monday in Bonn.,
16912,Thousands of delegates from over 170 countries will negotiate climate goals at the 23rd annual conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).,
16913,"The conference runs until 17 November, marking the first time that delegates are convening since the USA announced its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.",
16914,"Presiding over this year’s conference is the Republic of Fiji, an island nation that is already feeling the effects of climate change: 45 villages, for example, have had to be resettled due to rising sea levels.",
16915,"The economist Prof. Dr. Anke Gerber conducts research on, among other things, international agreements.",
16916,"In this interview, she explains to what extent this kind of climate agreement can be binding and what it takes to implement it.",
16917,"In 2015 delegates negotiated the Paris Agreement, an international climate agreement that went into effect in November 2016 and was ratified for the first time by countries such as China and the United States—two of the world’s largest carbon polluters.",
16918,"It is already becoming clear, however, that several industrialized nations will not be able to meet the goals outlined in the Agreement and ambitious plans will fall short of the 2-degree global warming limit while the USA under Trump has now pulled out of the Agreement entirely.",
16919,An international agreement like the Paris Agreement is binding according to international law.,
16920,"This does not mean much, however, because generally, breaching international law does not result in sanctions.",
16921,"This means that the Paris Agreement, like the Kyoto Protocol before it, is entirely voluntary.",
16922,The signatory countries can decide on their own climate protection measures but so far there is no regulatory framework for checking and implementing resolutions.,
16923,There need to be tangible sanctions if a country does not reach its stated goals.,
16924,"This is difficult, however, in an international context.",
16925,Sovereign states have virtually no way of sanctioning one another without hurting themselves.,
16926,"This makes sanctions negotiable, undermining their purpose.",
16927,"Thus, we need, first, an independent institution authorized to sanction in an emergency and is immune to demands for re-negotiations.",
16928,"Second, this institution needs to be equipped with effective sanctioning strategies.",
16929,"Philipp Wichardt from the University of Rostock and I have been conducting research on international agreements and we recommend the following procedure: Once they have decided upon their individual climate protection measures, the individual countries pay a kind of security deposit to an independent institution (for example, the World Bank).",
16930,"If a country meets its own obligation, it gets the deposit back.",
16931,"Otherwise, the country forfeits its right to the repayment of the deposit.",
16932,The deposit amount just needs to be fixed at a rate high enough that the individual countries would feel compelled for purely economic reasons to meet their stated goals rather than lose their deposit.,
16933,The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty that obligates its signatory countries to reduce or eradicate chemical emissions that deplete the ozone.,
16934,"The treaty was and continues to be very successful, but the situation is not comparable to the Paris Agreement.",
16935,"Rejecting ozone-depleting substances is, relatively speaking, cheap and it has immediate, significant, and direct effects.",
16936,"In the case of carbon emissions, the costs are substantially higher and the first beneficiaries will be future generations.",
16937,A rule book stipulates how to review the individual countries’ climate protection measures.,
16938,An agreement about procedures for regular evaluations is indispensable if the Paris Agreement is going to be effective.,
16939,I don’t have any great expectations because I don’t see much willingness on the part of the major players to reach the 2-degree goal.,
16940,Just look at the coalition talks in Germany.,
16941,"Maybe we need a few dramatic natural disasters first to increase voter pressure before anything really happens.
",
16942,This year Fiji presided over the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23).,
16943,"The island nation is already struggling with the effects of climate change: for example, 45 villages have had to be resettled due to rising sea levels.",
16944,Prof. Dr. Beate Ratter researches the ways island nations adapt to climate change.,
16945,"In this interview, the geographer explains that a rise in the sea level is not the biggest problem threatening island states.",
16946,I can think of several problems that climate change poses for small island states.,
16947,They can be more or less serious depending on the island’s location and resources.,
16948,"Above all, the increased intensity and frequency of major storms can be life-threatening.",
16949,Storms and attendant rainfall are a problem for island populations who do not have the financial or technical resources to protect themselves.,
16950,"The rise in sea level, which leads to increasingly strong swells that can lead to flooding, will have dramatic consequences.",
16951,The long-term intrusion of saltwater into scarce freshwater lenses on shallow coral islands are a very big problem for fresh water supply.,
16952,And coral reef destruction due to rising sea temperatures—including the so-called “coral bleaching”—is lethal for tropical coral islands.,
16953,"Moreover, marine pollution and waste in the oceans adversely affect corals.",
16954,Corals offer natural protection against ocean forces.,
16955,"If they are destroyed, erosion attacks the islands directly.",
16956,"We can’t say generally because, for example, the Shishmaref Island in Alaska is facing threats different from those that Addu Atoll in the southern Maldives faces.",
16957,"The northern Maldives are suffering increasingly from drought while the southern Maldives are dealing with severe flooding, like they did in the 2017 monsoon season.",
16958,Every island and every place faces its own unique threats.,
16959,"A shallow coral island located just meters above the current sea level will face increasing waves, coastal erosion, and flooding.",
16960,An island with cliffs is immune to direct beach erosion but increasing erosion will also attack those cliffs and endanger settlements with coastal housing and other critical infrastructure.,
16961,Or let’s take St. Helena in the southern Atlantic.,
16962,Supply ships are finding it ever harder to land due to increasing sea swell and you can’t even fly into the new airport in heavy storms.,
16963,"It’s important, for example, to avoid constructing buildings, streets, and hotels directly on the beach.",
16964,This would protect the beaches from further erosion and flooding.,
16965,It would also help if wetlands and mangrove forests were put under conservation because these borders between sea and land act as natural buffers and should not be built on or chopped down.,
16966,I’m afraid that at the Climate Conference too many different national and economic interests are at play for us to expect a quick agreement.,
16967,"People in regions facing rising sea levels can do something to a certain degree: they can take matters into their own hands, although they need to adapt to conditions.",
16968,"Building walls on beach fronts, for example, usually increases rather than mitigates erosion.",
16969,And carting beach sand away to build housing poses additional problems for small islands.,
16970,"I think it’s much more important, however, for responsible governments not just to assign blame for climate change but to look to what can be done with regard to landscaping, investment decisions, and anti-corruption measures so that the effects of climate change don’t increase and their own people no longer suffer.",
16971,We are very well-equipped for dealing with storm tides and rising sea level on the North Sea coast for the next several decades.,
16972,"We have hundreds of years of experience, the technical know-how, the financial resources, and well-functioning coastal protection.",
16973,The historical catastrophes and the flood of 1962 have helped us.,
16974,The fight against the sea is not only ingrained in our collective memory; it also motivates state coastal protection authorities to continuously improve.,
16975,"The most recent dike reinforcements, for example in Büsum or the North Beach in Schleswig-Holstein, have introduced the so-called “climate dikes.”",
16976,These are wider and lower and include reserves for building higher.,
16977,"If the onrushing tide is higher than expected, we can heighten the dike without having to alter the foundation.",
16978,"Yet here, perhaps, we will face a problem in the future.",
16979,"People on the North Sea coast rely on state coastal protection authorities but we still need to learn how to deal with water from the hinterlands, flooding tributaries, and heavy rains that even now overflow sewer systems and destroy windows and sun rooms.
",
16980,Delegates from all over the world have convened in Bonn to agree on common goals to combat climate change and to develop a system that allows us to measure the contributions made by individual states.,
16981,"Once upon a time, Germany was regarded internationally as a leader in combating climate change.",
16982,"Now it is clear that Germany will fall short of its climate goals, in part because businesses lack sufficient incentives to pursue effective climate-saving strategies.",
16983,The economist Prof. Dr. Grischa Perino is an expert on ecological economics.,
16984,In this interview he explains what measures could effectively protect our climate.,
16985,"Due to the time remaining and the magnitude of [emissions] to be saved, reaching the German climate goals for 2020 would now only be possible through drastic measures.",
16986,"In the time remaining, emissions would have to fall three times as fast as they have done on average since 1990.",
16987,"A large proportion of the reductions achieved, however, took place before 2000 as a result of the closure of factories and plants originating in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).",
16988,"According to the German Environment Agency (UBA), greenhouse gas emissions in Germany have remained at more or less the same level since 2009.",
16989,"Rather than trying to achieve the 2020 goals in a chaotic flurry, I think it is more important that Germany and the EU concentrate on setting the course for the 2030 and 2050 goals.",
16990,One of the most frequently discussed suggestions it the phasing out of coal.,
16991,"By quickly shutting down German coal power plants, it would be possible to greatly reduce Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions.",
16992,"Due to the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), which stipulates an EU-wide upper limit for greenhouse gases in various sectors—including the energy sector—and generates tradable emissions certificates, this reduction of German emissions would be counterpointed by a similarly large hike in emissions in other member states.",
16993,"Certificates made available through coal power plant closures would not cease to exist; they would be used for another purpose, for example, in a foreign power plant or a German aluminum smelter.",
16994,But the climate does not care where an additional ton is emitted.,
16995,"That is why it is important to focus German efforts on sectors that are not subject to the EU-ETS—road transport, decentral heat production, and agriculture—and at the same time fortify the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.",
16996,This last point is what is happening right now in Brussels—largely out of view of the public.,
16997,The upper limit for 2030 will be greatly reduced compared to what it would have been under the present regulations.,
16998,There are various reasons for that.,
16999,"On the one hand, there is the technical challenge of storing enough energy in a small space and with as little weight as possible while simultaneously meeting the expectations of drivers with regards to range and comfort without resorting to fossil fuels.",
17000,"For German makers, this problem is exacerbated by the market segment to which they cater.",
17001,"Cars in the upper middle and high-end classes are expected to have high performance, which generally leads to greater energy requirements.",
17002,"In addition to this, some firms appear to have thought there was greater promise in agitating for laxer regulations as opposed to cleaner motors.",
17003,"To reduce emissions in the transport sector, we need a bundle of measures.",
17004,"Parallel to stricter regulations for vehicles, investing in climate-friendly infrastructure is particularly sensible.",
17005,"As well as charging stations for electric cars, attractive public transport and rail freight systems, high quality and safe bike path networks, and urban planning that reduces traffic.",
17006,"Yet all of this will only have an effect after 2020.
",
17007,A campus tour or rally is a standard feature of most orientation modules at the beginning of the winter semester.,
17008,These will not take place this year due to coronavirus measures.,
17009,"As an alternative, we have prepared a video campus tour.",
17010,"The focus is the Von-Melle-Park campus, including the Main Building, Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky, and Audimax.",
17011,"In addition to interesting facts, it provides some historical insight, the most important hygiene rules for all University buildings, and links to further information.",
17012,An English version is being prepared.,
17013,"We wish you lots of fun discovering Universität Hamburg!
",
17014,"Summer Semester 2020 will take place digitally, and preparations for Winter Semester 2020/21 are underway.",
17015,Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.,
17016,"Dieter Lenzen, president of Universität Hamburg, reports on the status of the discussions in a new video message.",
17017,"Combined with a heartfelt thank you to all University staff for what has been achieved so far, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.",
17018,"Dieter Lenzen looks back on the period since February, the challenges overcome, and the digital summer semester.",
17019,"Above all, however, he focuses on the considerations concerning the forthcoming winter semester.",
17020,View the video (lower video resolution on Lecture2Go) or read the transcript (below) to find out what the foreseeable social distancing rules would mean for study activities.,
17021,"Dear Members and Staff of Universität Hamburg, I speak to you today—at the midway point of the summer semester, as it were—during one of the biggest crises to face the University, the City of Hamburg, and our country.",
17022,"On 23 February of this year, patient zero arrived in Hamburg—a pediatrician from our clinic, of all people—and, as a result, the virus was in the city and also at the University.",
17023,"Since then, for more than 4 months now, not one of us has experienced a hint of normality.",
17024,"At the same time, we have learned that we can adapt to many things, and we managed to save the summer semester—which seemed so uncertain at first.",
17025,There were many who called for the semester to be canceled completely.,
17026,"The consequences of doing that would have been considerable for you, our students, but also for the teaching staff who were ready to teach the semester.",
17027,We have tried to seriously consider the needs and concerns of everyone involved—all staff as well as those indirectly affected by the situation—and to come up with solutions as far as we possibly could.,
17028,"After a few initial difficulties, we developed a presentable digital solution despite the fact that the university environment is clearly at its best as a physical world.",
17029,That is why the opening of our universities in Germany is currently under discussion.,
17030,"However, the German U15—the largest research universities in Germany—have ruled out a full return to physical attendance during the semester, but for a completely different reason: as long as the social distancing rule applies, which effectively has the force of law, individuals will be required to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 meters while attending lectures.",
17031,"In our case, even if we were to use the Audimax, which has over 1,500 seats, only 160 people would be able to attend a lecture at any one time.",
17032,That makes it clear that it is not possible for everyone to attend lectures in person.,
17033,And that immediately raises the following questions: Who is allowed to attend in person?,
17034,What courses can be done in person?,
17035,Who makes that decision?,
17036,Why?,
17037,Based on what criteria?,
17038,That cannot be.,
17039,"Regardless of that discussion, the city government’s decisions continue to apply, also to us.",
17040,"Therefore, we have to start thinking about how we are going to proceed with the winter semester.",
17041,"If social distancing rules are maintained, or if increased knowledge about aerosols and their role in spreading infection results in increased restrictions, the situation may in fact become more difficult.",
17042,"One thing we do know is that if social distancing continues to apply, the winter semester will also have to be conducted predominantly in digital form.",
17043,"We have calculated that we would only be able to conduct 25% of the over 5,000 courses that usually take place in the University’s rooms.",
17044,"Therefore, we have begun talks within the U15 as well as within the German Rectors’ Conference (HRK), which represents all German higher education institutions.",
17045,"Although we do not yet know which way these talks will lead, we must make a decision on the winter semester very soon.",
17046,"Of course, we are in constant communication with the relevant authorities, who are also issuing regulations, and we place a great deal of importance on preserving the imperative of academic freedom in all our considerations.",
17047,"This is a principle at the constitutional level, as is the preservation of life and limb.",
17048,This means that health comes first.,
17049,That is why we are also happy that we have not had a single fatality among the staff and students at the University.,
17050,"This is most certainly the result of our strict observance of safety measures, for which I—in the name of the Executive University Board—would like to thank you all.",
17051,"Our number of infections peaked at nine, a comparatively small number.",
17052,This was not the case everywhere: mass outbreaks like those seen in Göttingen recently and other areas show us how quickly infection rates can spiral with large indoor gatherings.,
17053,"We have decided to carefully assess the results of the digital teaching at the the end of the semester in order to evaluate what was successful and what needs to be rethought, as this format is in no way viable for the long term.",
17054,"The key idea here is “blended learning,” a mix of digital and in-person teaching, as far as that is possible.",
17055,The most important thing is that we keep to the rules for the sake of the health and future of all of us.,
17056,"Once again, I thank you all for persevering.",
17057,"The semester will be over in a few weeks, and then we will see how things develop.",
17058,I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all well.,
17059,"Stay healthy, and—if I may say so—hang in there.",
17060,I will do my best to keep you up to date.,
17061,"We post regular updates on our FAQ page and in our situation reports so that you can see the newest developments, including with regard to the official instructions we are obliged to issue.",
17062,"I thank you and, for today, say goodbye.

17063,"Pamela Whitten, President of Indiana University visited Universität Hamburg on 1 November 2022 to discuss current projects and potential additional collaborations.",
17064,Students and doctoral researchers will also be able to take part in a joint scholarship competition.,
17065,Universität Hamburg and Indiana University in the USA have been working closely together since the 1960s.,
17066,"In 2019, both universities agree to found a strategic partnership to provide more targeted and long-term support for collaborative activities.",
17067,"The most recent successes to arise from this collaboration include a joint teaching project as part of the Global Classroom Program, a multilateral research collaboration within the Next Generation Partnerships, as well as the expansion of a strategic collaboration between the Faculty of Education and the Indiana University School of Education.",
17068,"As part of the visit, Hauke Heekeren, president of Universität Hamburg, and Pamela Whitten, president of Indiana University agreed that this successful partnership should continue and grow into the future.",
17069,"In addition to management discussions, the program also included discussions with the UKE, the Faculty of Education, with vice-president Susanne Rupp and with the Knowledge Exchange Agency.",
17070,"Currently, students and doctoral researchers at Universität Hamburg can actively get involved in the partnership and contribute to peaceful and fair co-existence.",
17071,"To participate, they had to submit a video or audio contribution to a scientific poster as part of a UN Sustainability Goal 16—Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions Competition.",

17075,The entire management level of Lund University and representatives of the student body were present.,
17076,"The visit focused on exchanging ideas about the universities’ strategic goals and development, including the development of science parks and science cities—an area in which Lund University has gained a lot of experience following the 2011 opening of the Ideon Science Park.",
17077,"Accordingly, the delegation started its visit at Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld, where it visited the Hamburg Advanced Research Centre for Bioorganic Chemistry (HARBOR), the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), and the Centre for Structural Systems Biology (CSSB) and met the scientists working there.",
17078,"Afterwards, thematic sessions were held on the main campus to examine the future of the partnership and joint projects and to exchange ideas on important future topics such as digitalization, sustainability, career paths in academia, diversity, and equal opportunity.",
17079,The universities joined forces in 2016 to form a strategic partnership.,
17080,"Since then, the partnership has led to even closer cooperation on the topics of research, education, and management.",
17081,A number of research contacts and research collaborations exist between the institutions.,

17090,"Hamburg Mayor, Dr Peter Tschentscher, and University President Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. Dieter Lenzen toasting Universität Hamburg’s success.",
17091,Cheers to that: Universität Hamburg represents the Hanseatic City of Hamburg and the whole of northern Germany as one of the university institutions to be recognized as Universities of Excellence.,
17092,"Photo: UHH/Ohme Dr. Peter Tschentscher followed the announcement live in the University administration building in Mittelweg, and offered his personal congratulations.",
17093,Photo: UHH/Ohme Spontaneous and resounding applause: Delight at the hotly-awaited decision.,
17094,Heads held high: walking with a smile into a new era as a University of Excellence.,
17095,Universität Hamburg is a University of Excellence.,
17096,"The official announcement was made by the Federal Minister of Education and Research, Anja Karliczek, today in Bonn.",
17097,The announcement was enthusiastically followed by many delighted members of the University via livestream.,
17098,"Balloons, confetti and happy cheers erupted from the Executive University Board, staff and guests as the announcement was made for the second funding line of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments (ExStra).",
17099,President of Universität Hamburg Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. Dieter Lenzen said: “Mission accomplished: we did it!,
17100,"For the first time in the history of its existence, there can be absolutely no doubt about it: our University is certified top class.",
17101,"First of all, I want to thank the many members of the University, from the researchers to the coordinators and management staff, who contributed to this accomplishment.",
17102,"In addition, I also want to thank those members whose daily work facilitated such a triumph: From our HR staff to our building service teams, student assistants and lab technicians, our professors and our research associates.",
17103,"Starting today, I never again want to hear Universität Hamburg is “at best average.”",
17104,That is now proven to be untrue.,
17105,"The German Council of Science and Humanities has seen the sharp increase in performance over the past five years, which along with our shared concept of a flagship university, was the reason for our success.",
17106,"All crew members and passengers on this great journey ahead of us will work closely together to safely navigate our way to further success, and to continue to serve the City of Hamburg.",
17107,This journey will simply be first-rate!”,
17108,ExStra is a competition for funding for top-level university research in Germany.,
17109,Universities of Excellence thus serve as Germany’s flagships in the international flotilla of higher education institutions.,
17110,"In this vein, the Universität Hamburg proposal was submitted under the slogan ‘A Flagship University:",
17111,Innovating and Cooperating for a Sustainable Future.’,
17112,Universität Hamburg’s excellence proposal contains 24 measures to be implemented over the next 7 years using the funds granted.,
17113,"The University will appoint 11 new professorships with top-level researchers, invite numerous visiting scholars to come to Hamburg to conduct research and teach, and will launch additional funding instruments such as a fund to provide quick and unbureaucratic support for research projects.",
17114,"The entire University will profit immensely from these 24 measures,” explained Prof. Lenzen.",
17115,"Universität Hamburg had already gained funding for all 4 of its proposed clusters of excellence in late 2018.Since then, Hamburg has been considered a hot candidate for University of Excellence funding.",
17116,A total of 17 universities and 2 university consortia applied for this funding.,
17117,"The 10 winning universities and 1 university consortium will receive a total of €148 million in funding per year, initially until 2026, when they will be evaluated.",
17118,"If the evaluation is positive, the grant will be extended for at least 7 more years.
",
17119,It is now official: Universität Hamburg is one of eleven Universities of Excellence in Germany.,
17120,"What, however, does that mean for Universität Hamburg?",
17121,What steps can or must it now take?,
17122,Where will it go from here?,
17123,"The University’s president, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.",
17124,"Dieter Lenzen, explains what it means to be a “University of Excellence.”",
17125,"President Lenzen explained that, in the future, the University will actively pursue the measures it applied for in 5 so-called “performance areas.”",
17126,"These areas are research, teaching, research infrastructure, transfer, and internationalization.",
17127,"For students, for example, there will be more grants and scholarships for study abroad and additional courses and programs such as the Studium Generale or the liberal arts.",
17128,"Thanks to additional funding from the city, buildings will continue to be renovated, refurbished, and built.",
17129,"See the video for more information.

17132,"Now, a team headed by the biophysicist Dr. Andrea Thorn from Universität Hamburg has created a new model of the virus and made it publicly available.",
17133,Dr. Thorn researches the molecular structure of the coronavirus.,
17134,"“We often worked closely with the original authors of scientific studies and sought answers to questions about the virus’ structural biology from pharmaceutical developers: how it penetrates a cell, what is looks like, what consequences mutations have for the function of the virus,” said Thorn.",
17135,"In March 2020, she had already put together an international team of scientists, the Coronavirus Structural Task Force, for her research.",
17136,"Today, 26 researchers from 7 countries are involved and the group is being coordinated by Universität Hamburg.",
17137,"The task force’s new model corrects earlier assumptions about the virus’ physical appearance:for example, the virus is smaller than initially assumed.",
17138,Its spike proteins are very flexible and they swim inside the virus envelope.,
17139,"The number of spike proteins is also lower than initially assumed: while SARS-CoV-1 has roughly 100, the coronavirus has about 25.",
17140,The team has created a comprehensive collection of images available to the public and in cooperation with the University of Utah a video that shows a lung cell infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.,
17141,You can see the 3D model online or even create one yourself with a 3D printer.,
17142,"There are also instructions and scientific information on the model.

17149,"President Lenzen, Science Senator Katharina Fegebank, and Dr. Alexander Gerst, astronaut and alumnus came together for the ceremony.",
17150,"Universität Hamburg celebrates its 100th anniversary, exactly 100 years to the day after its official opening.",
17151,"Over 1,400 guests, including many honorary guests and prominent alumni, attended the ceremony while several thousand University members let their hair down at the Campus party.",
17152,"It was a day to remember for everyone, from the Bundestag president to first-year students.",
17153,The festivities began with an official ceremony and a campus party that went on into the evening hours.,
17154,"Dr. Wolfgang Schäuble joined the ceremony from Berlin, Dr. Alexander Gerst all the way from space, and comedian Otto Waalkes from his Blankenese residence.",
17155,Waalkes even had one of his original artworks in tow as a gift to the University.,
17156,Why the celebration?,
17157,"Exactly 100 years ago, on 10 May 1919, Universität Hamburg was officially founded; at the time, it had 1,700 students.",
17158,"Today, the University boasts over 43,000 students.",
17159,"At 12 noon, anchorwoman and mistress of ceremonies Julia Sen greeted guests in the Audimax: “I am very excited about today because, like many guests here, I am also a proud alumna of this University!”",
17160,Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.,
17161,"Dieter Lenzen, president of the University, also greeted the roughly 1,400 guests, saying: “Look at this University and what its members have accomplished!",
17162,"Thanks to them, the University has evolved into an uncompromising institution of enlightenment.”",
17163,"Tschentcher, Hamburg’s mayor: The entire city is proud Then comedian Otto Waalkes took to the stage, which he remembers fondly: this is where, in 1972, Waalkes recorded the first album for the show that made his name.",
17164,"Waalkes presented his own artwork, which he dedicated to Universität Hamburg: an “Ottifant”—an elephant cartoon named after Otto and the majestic mammal—with a cap and scroll.",
17165,"“This is the first Ottifant with a university degree,” said Waalkes.",
17166,He then congratulated the University and regaled the audience with his inimitable yodeling.,
17167,"The Unifant is also now available as a key chain, postcard, or magnet set from the Unikontor.",
17168,"Peter Tschentscher, Hamburg’s mayor and formerly a medical student at the University, emphasized the University’s value for the city.",
17169,"“The entire city is proud and celebrates with you,” he told the gathered University members.",
17170,"He continued, “Science and scholarship are good for Hamburg because knowledge of the potential for technical and social progress is the decisive factor in our future development.",
17171,"Today, the great discoveries are not being made in the seas or on strange continents but in laboratories and research institutions.",
17172,Science gives us the decisive edge.”,
17173,Schäuble: Hamburg is its university!,
17174,Dr. Wolfgang Schäuble is also a University alumnus.,
17175,"In the 1960s, he studied law here.",
17176,"The president of the German Bundestag spoke with urgency about why independent science and scholarship constitutes a pillar of democratic societies; in an increasingly complex world with vanishing certainties, science and scholarship can provide orientation.",
17177,"He addressed the members of the University with these words: “I wish for Universität Hamburg that the researchers, teachers, and students gathered here today continue with all of their powers to shape freedom as guaranteed in our Basic Law and to defend intellectual freedom—in the interests of a city which ensures this freedom in research, teaching, and education.",
17178,"And which, after its first 100 years, can say with confidence and pride:",
17179,Hamburg is its university!”,
17180,"The Universität Hamburg banner—around the Earth 3,061 times As commandeer of the ISS, Alexander Gerst had already sent greetings to the University, above all to its students, from space.",
17181,Now he appeared in person to congratulate the University on its 100th anniversary and to accept a special honor: President Lenzen formerly presented the former doctoral student with an honorary senator certificate.,
17182,"“In academia, as in space travel, we often face difficult professional challenges,” Gerst said.",
17183,"“When a university makes it easy to do research, then it is a good university.",
17184,"In this respect, Universität Hamburg is a good university.",
17185,"It provided me, when I was a doctoral student, with outstanding research conditions.”",
17186,"As a gift, the astronaut brought a University banner that he had taken with him for his 197 days on the ISS.",
17187,"“It has traveled with me 3,061 times around Earth and covered more the 130 million kilometers—that is just about the distance between Hamburg and the sun,” said Gerst.",
17188,"A sustainable university Honorary senator and patron of the University, Prof. Dr. Michael Otto, was on stage to witness the awarding of the certificate.",
17189,"In the 1960s, the chair of the board for the Otto Group studied economics at Universität Hamburg.",
17190,"He praised the University for its research on sustainability: “When I was studying, the preservation of nature and climate protection were not major topics.",
17191,"Since then, however, a lot has happened: Today, several research areas, including an entire cluster of excellence, focus on these issues.”",
17192,"Among the guests in the Audimax were students, staff, teachers, alumni, members of partner schools, and friends and patrons of the University from the business, cultural, and societal sectors.",
17193,"At the end of the ceremony, some raised a glass of sparkling wine to toast the University while others headed over to the festivities on the Main Campus at Von-Melle-Park.",
17194,The University’s biggest-ever campus party The Main Campus was the site of the University’s largest party in its history.,
17195,"It attracted over 1,000 visitors.",
17196,"Among the program highlights were a poetry slam, a performance by the theater group Kalliope, soccer-playing robots, street-art workshops, and a photo bus offering snap shots.",
17197,"Staff members’ and students’ children could jump around in a bouncy castle, have their faces painted, or get a balloon animal.",
17198,"The student council, AStA, organized live music: The Norwegian punk-pop band Sløtface was the main-stage attraction; Blowm & Maddin un de Maudefaades performed their “Plattdütsch” or Low German rap, and the Hamburg pop band Dein Fadinzt celebrated the absurdities of life.",
17199,"The AStA chari Karim Kuropka said, “In the last 100 years, the University has progressively fought for sound education and we hope it will continue to do so in the future.”",
17200,"And it was to the future that everyone on the Campus raised a glass—a fantastic fest for an historical day!

17201,"This year, the 27th World Climate Conference is taking place in Egypt.",
17202,"Dr. Jan Wilkens from the Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS) to attend as a spectator.",
17203,He is an expert in guiding climate policy and climate justice.,
17204,Definitely.,
17205,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given extra impetus to matters like the global food crisis and energy security across the world.,
17206,"The question is, how can the bigger states keep to the agenda, despite this situation.",
17207,The challenge of this year’s World Climate Conference is one of implementation.,
17208,"So, there will not be new targets, but a focus on how to implement the climate goals and measures we have already agreed.",
17209,We will also be making a balance sheet to look at how successful the individual countries have been in keeping to their commitments.,
17210,"We must consider justice across the board, from the very beginning.",
17211,Often it is a matter of financial support.,
17212,We need a form of financing that makes money easily available to endangered regions in the Global South.,
17213,Funding commitments that have already been made must be paid.,
17214,"As the majority of the funding commitments involve loans, we must also consider that they carry increased debt loads.",
17215,"Generally speaking, that means that groups who are suffering the most from climate change, and who have done the least to contribute to climate change, will continue to be dependent, further increasing inequality.",
17216,That is why we should be offering financial aid instead of loans.,
17217,But the states of the Global North have not yet taken sufficient steps towards meeting their historical responsibilities.,
17218,Every economically-strong country negotiating here is following a growth-oriented goal.,
17219,You can see it in their belief in innovation and technological solutions to reducing emissions while maintaining their form of economic activity.,
17220,"Personally, I am not convinced.",
17221,"On a finite planet, we have to limit the consumption of natural resources.",
17222,"Even technological solutions use raw materials, like for example, rare earths.",
17223,"They are doing that already, although to a limited extent.",
17224,Many countries and companies see a future market and are looking to position themselves as best they can.,
17225,"The belief in technical solutions however carries a danger that we will not really act, but simply push the making of changes into the future.",
17226,"In reality, there is not yet any technology that is sufficiently developed to even begin to meet these goals.",
17227,"On the contrary, according to the Climate Action Tracker, we are moving towards a world with an average temperature increase of about 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, instead of limiting warming to 1.5, as we decided at the World Climate Conference in 2015.",
17228,"A longer version of this interview is available on the Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS) webpage.
",
17229,"An international team of researchers, which on behalf of Universität Hamburg is coordinated by Prof. Dr. Dr. Christian Betzel and Prof. Dr. Arwen Pearson, has identified several candidates for drugs against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using DESY´s X-ray lightsource PETRA III.",
17230,"In addition, a new binding site on the virus was discovered.",
17231,The results were published online in the journal Science.,
17232,"In contrast to vaccines, which help healthy people to defend themselves against the virus, drug research develops medicines that can slow down or stop the reproduction of the virus in the body of people who are already infected.",
17233,"One promising target is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, an important protein of the virus.",
17234,"If the main protease could be blocked, it might be possible to interrupt the virus replication cycle.",
17235,"The researchers, under the leadership of Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron DESY, tested almost 6000 known active compounds that already exist for the treatment of other diseases in a relatively short period of time by using a high-throughput X-ray screening approach.",
17236,"As part of this effort the university groups produced large quantities of protein, helped grow crystals, harvested crystals prior to data collection and helped build a database that tracked each compound from start to finish in the massive screening experiment.",
17237,DESY´s PETRA III facility houses state-of-the-art experimental stations for structural biology where the three-dimensional structure of proteins can be imaged with atomic precision using X-rays.,
17238,"“We first investigated, whether and how the compounds “dock” to the main protease,” says Dr. Arwen Pearson, professor of biophysics and a researcher in the Cluster of Excellence “CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter.“",
17239,"Due to the high automation at the PETRA III stations P11, P 13 and P14, measuring each of the more than 7000 samples only took a few minutes.",
17240,"“Using this high-throughput method, we were able to find a total of 37 active compounds that bind to the main protease,” says Alke Meents from DESY, who initiated the project with Christian Betzel in March 2020.",
17241,"In a next step, the researchers at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine investigated whether these active compounds inhibit or even prevent virus replication in cell cultures and how well they are tolerated by human cells.",
17242,"This reduced the number of candidate active compounds to seven, two of which stood out in particular.",
17243,"In their drug screening using protein crystallography, the researchers did not examine fragments of potential drugs, as is usually the case in such screening campaigns, but instead complete drug molecules.",
17244,"In the process, however, the team of more than 100 scientists also discovered something completely unexpected: a previously unknown binding site on the main protease.",
17245,"“It was not only a nice surprise that we were able to discover a new drug binding site on the main protease, but that one of the two promising drug candidates binds precisely to this site,” says Dr. Dr. Christian Betzel, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Universität Hamburg and also a member of “CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter”.",
17246,"The preclinical studies with the two promising compounds pelitinib and calpeptin are currently being conducted at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo (USP), with which UHH has a long-standing collaboration in the field of structural infection biology and where Betzel is a visiting professor.",
17247,"We arranged the possibility to do preclinical studies in advance in March 2020, so that we wouldn\t lose any time if our screening programme was successful, Betzel said.",
17248,"The studies are expected to last 5 months, after which further clinical testing will be necessary.
",
17249,"One reason Universität Hamburg, northern Germany’s largest research institution, was named a University of Excellence was in recognition of its role as a “flagship university.”",
17250,"True to this concept, the University would like to further develop and fortify cooperation among various universities and non-university research institutions in the greater Hamburg region.",
17251,Dr. Elisabeth Hettig explains the next steps.,
17252,Her position was created precisely for this purpose.,
17253,Cooperation strengthens Hamburg generally and that benefits all partners.,
17254,It is also good for us if the world sees Hamburg as a place where science and scholarship are conducted at a high level and are highly valued.,
17255,"Furthermore, Universität Hamburg, as a wide-ranging comprehensive institution, profits from cooperation with other partners—the University’s 4 clusters of excellence, which are based on such cooperation, exemplify this.",
17256,"For example, the detailed simulations of future climate and environmental conditions that the Climate, Climatic Change, and Society cluster are working on would not have been possible without the calculation capabilities of the German Climate Computing Center.",
17257,And the search for matter with new properties at The Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging: Cluster of Excellence Advanced Imaging of Matter would have been inconceivable without the use of the world’s largest x-ray laser at the European XFEL.,
17258,Definitely.,
17259,There are short communication pathways between institutions as well as to the government bodies involved in science and research.,
17260,"In city-states, you can engage more often and perhaps more intensively.",
17261,"The proximity also enables people to share research infrastructure without red tape, as they have been doing, for example, for a long time in Bahrenfeld.",
17262,And measures such as joint appointments or support for early career researchers in cooperative graduate schools can be implemented more easily.,
17263,"Our most important project and instrument is the Partnership for Innovation, Education and Research, or PIER Hamburg for short.",
17264,PIER Hamburg builds upon a long-standing tradition of successful cooperation and began with cooperation between Universität Hamburg and DESY.,
17265,"Today, it forms an alliance of 12 partners, including, for example, Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH), Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hans-Bredow-Institut for Media Research, and several Fraunhofer institutes and Max Planck institutions.",
17266,"With PIER Hamburg, we are now for the first time establishing cooperation to provide a framework for multifaceted exchange and collaboration among higher education institutions and non-university research institutions.",
17267,There has been no such framework as yet.,
17268,"Such an ambitious alliance not only facilitates more intensive links between research activities; PIER Hamburg also allows partners to work on common topics such as support for early career researchers, digitalization, or knowledge transfer, which transcend the boundaries of individual research areas or institutions.",
17269,PIER Hamburg’s steering committee meets twice a year to discuss current strategic issues and basic concerns.,
17270,"Furthermore, as part of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments at Universität Hamburg, annual funding is available to support partners’ cooperation projects.",
17271,My own position was also created to cultivate PIER Hamburg.,
17272,"Currently, we are focusing on, among other things, developing research cooperation and funding and support activities.
",
17273,"With financing through the second funding line of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments, Universität Hamburg appointed its first chief digital officer (CDO) at the beginning of 2021.",
17274,"In his interview, Dr. Sebastian Gerling talks about his tasks, objectives, and specific areas of focus.",
17275,There are many interpretations of the CDO role; it differs from organization to organization.,
17276,"At Universität Hamburg, I—together with all those involved—will develop a digitalization vision and a corresponding digitalization strategy.",
17277,"So, I have a coordinating role and have to consider where we as a university want to be in 5 to 10 years in terms of digitalization, as well as in terms of research, teaching, and administration.",
17278,My objective is to develop visionary ideas that also positively represent us outwardly.,
17279,"As CDO, I not only want to keep my finger on the pulse of technology but also want to see in which areas we, as a university, can do completely new things— things that no one else is doing, which could possibly set us apart us as a precursor.",
17280,"Of course, for a start, it was about getting to know lots of areas and people.",
17281,"In the current pandemic, this means that I’ve been holding a lot of videoconferences in particular.",
17282,I’ve been looking at the current state of digitalization and also talking about needs and wants.,
17283,"From that, I’ve been able to get an initial overall picture of things.",
17284,"However, my first impression is that the University is already well positioned in certain areas, has a computing center with a lot of expertise, and—through a lot of effort—has developed a good basis for a holistic and sustainable digital transformation.",
17285,"We first became aware of this during the pandemic, during which the switch to digital working and digital teaching worked out so well, despite the exceptional situation, thanks to the endeavor of all involved.",
17286,"However, we still have a long way to go to achieve a successful digital transformation based on a sustainable infrastructure.",
17287,"Yes, it’s about all areas of the University and all cross-cutting issues.",
17288,"Alongside research, teaching, and administration, innovation and transfer play an important role.",
17289,"A university represents a significant challenge, because—as an institution—it is extremely diverse.",
17290,"For me, it is important that we develop shared goals for digitalization and factor in the interests and needs of the faculties, students, and employees.",
17291,This is the only way that we’ll generate broad acceptance of the issue.,
17292,"Ultimately, it would be great to develop—together—a modern, digital interpretation of the University that is sustainably competitive and unique in Germany.",
17293,"For me, it’s important to understand that digitalization only works if users make use of the new features with excitement and conviction.",
17294,We shouldn’t only digitalize processes in principle and construct a digital infrastructure; we should also place special focus on the user interface and try to design the applications to be as intuitive and as easy to use as possible.,
17295,"Today, children can already unlock smartphones from a very young age and operate them as a matter of course.",
17296,"In terms of usability, a lot has happened in the last few years, and I think that digitalization is achieved precisely at this interface.",
17297,I’m setting up a small team to support me with the development and implementation of the digitalization strategy.,
17298,"We will work closely together with actors from research, teaching, and administration—also with the new Smart Administration Unit, for instance.",
17299,I’ve been delighted with the warm reception I’ve received during my first few weeks at Universität Hamburg.,
17300,The work is a lot of fun.,
17301,"I’m looking forward to working with all colleagues and hope that, together, we can stabilize the strides made in digitalization—particularly those made in the last few years—and can achieve the University’s digital transformation with visionariness and success.
",
17302,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
17303,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
17304,"Prof. Dr. Eray Çaylı came to the University of Hamburg from the London School of Economics and Political Science in February 2023 to take up a professorship for Human Geography, with a Focus on Violence and Security in the Anthropocene.",
17305,I explore the intersection of violent histories and the contemporary politics of ecology especially in the region around today’s Turkey (where I also was born and grew up) and the diasporas that hail from that region.,
17306,My work engages critically with “the Anthropocene”—a scientific thesis that has proposed to name our current geological era after humanity (anthropos) as the single most decisive factor shaping the Earth’s workings and physical makeup.,
17307,"I complicate this imaginary of a homogeneous humanity through qualitative methods such as ethnography and an empirical focus on material and visual cultures, showing that “the Anthropocene” has in fact been caused by the authors and beneficiaries of violent political projects and has affected historically marginalized communities disproportionately.",
17308,This requires some background on the kind of biological family I come from.,
17309,"Both of my parents were born into working class families, were the first generation to receive university education, and then became civil servants (think of what is called the baby boomer generation in the Anglophone world).",
17310,"Because they personally experienced considerable upward social mobility during much of their adult life, they are now terribly worried about all the political and ecological upheaval affecting many parts of our warming and warring world.",
17311,But this is a particular kind of worry: it involves a sort of grief and despair that leaves unquestioned the founding tenets of the system that gave them their upward mobility.,
17312,I explain to them that my work encourages them to question these tenets and to empathize and show solidarity with those disadvantaged by the same unjust system that advantaged others (if to varying degrees).,
17313,"Incidentally, I also wrote a whole book in Turkish and for the general public so that my family—both biological and otherwise—could read my thoughts in a language they understand!",
17314,"Titled İklimin Estetiği, the book costs only about €1,50.",
17315,It won a literary award and has just entered its second print run.,
17316,I am glad to be working within a higher education system where the vast majority of study programmes are unconditionally tuition-free.,
17317,I am glad to be working for a university that thinks outside disciplinary boxes.,
17318,My post was advertised as an “open-topic professorship with a focus on violence and security in a planetary age”—oriented towards an urgent problem rather than a particular discipline.,
17319,It was this non-disciplinary and problem-focused orientation that caught my attention and led me to apply for the professorship.,
17320,"Although “interdisciplinarity” is on everyone’s lips in today’s higher education, seldom does a university take it so seriously as to incorporate it into institutional mechanisms.",
17321,"Moreover, this University is widely recognized as one of the world’s best universities for climate change research, as evidenced by its numerous research groups and clusters dedicated to this subject.",
17322,"I will be affiliated with one of these clusters (Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society or “CLICCS”)—another reason that makes my appointment feel right.",
17323,"Finally, the city itself deserves a mention.",
17324,"It hosts many vibrant communities and sites (urban spaces as well as museums) that are significant to my interests, my ways of working, and the parts of the world I come from and have worked on.",
17325,"In accessing the politics of violence and that of ecology, I use a material, spatial and visual focus because both these politics are markedly embodied.",
17326,This focus is also reflected in my teaching as I often use embodied (site-based and hands-on) pedagogical methods.,
17327,"Therefore, what Hamburg has to offer in this respect is an enormous plus for my teaching.",
17328,"Among my plans are the usual ones that any academic’s life involves, such as articles and books in progress, grant applications, and ideas for symposia, conferences, lecture series, and the like.",
17329,Mine currently revolve around the notion of emergency.,
17330,"As evidenced by the expression “the climate emergency,” the notion of emergency figures increasingly prominently in approaches to climate change today.",
17331,My ongoing projects intend to appraise this notion in relation to specific political traditions of emergency rule that prioritize securing states and capital (rather than the most vulnerable) and that tend to find their way into mainstream responses to climate change.,
17332,"These personal plans aside, the one plan that I am most excited about and wish to prioritize involves collaborating with colleagues—especially those at CLICCS.",
17333,"I am eager to see how my research interests and plans can not only contribute to their work but also be rethought and reworked in conversation with theirs so that we may approach the problems facing us collaboratively and dialogically, which really is the only way we can hope to achieve any progress.",
17334,I approach teaching as a dialogue rather than a monologue.,
17335,"Even when I lecture, I do my best to be interactive.",
17336,I believe that students learn as much from one another as they do from teachers.,
17337,"I therefore see my role as the facilitator of as best an environment as possible for thinking, working, and learning together rather than only as the conveyor of information in a single direction.",
17338,"The centrality of site visits and visual materials to my teaching (a centrality that, as I have tried to explain above, is required by the embodied character of both climate change and the legacies of violent histories) benefits this dialogic and interactive approach.",
17339,I maintain that critical thinking is first and foremost a practical skill—a vocation—and this is why students will find ample opportunities in my classes to develop it as such in collaboration with one another.,
17340,"An added benefit is that, due to my interdisciplinary and ethnographically informed approach, students attending my classes will find the opportunity to work from empirically fine-grained and context-specific understandings to access the urgent problems of our warring and warming world, rather than working from pre-existing disciplinary framings.",
17341,"That, of course, is not to dispute the importance of disciplinary specialisms.",
17342,"But disciplinary specialisation benefits from being complemented by an approach that works from concrete, lived, and embodied situations (rather than disciplines) to then create an environment where various disciplinary framings can converse with one another.",
17343,Students interested in such an approach should attend my classes.,
17344,"For the past twelve years, I have worked in the United Kingdom (the first half of it mainly at University College London and the second at London School of Economics and Political Science) and, therefore, most of my collaborators are based there.",
17345,"I have been a regular contributor to the British Academy’s workshops on violence, one of which resulted in a successful collaborative seed funding application involving academics from Canada as well—a collaboration that is ongoing.",
17346,"In continental Europe, I have had sustained working relationships with academics based at Wageningen University (the Netherlands) and Goethe University Frankfurt here in Germany and, in the US, those based at Syracuse University.",
17347,"Having worked mostly on Turkey to date, I have collaborated with universities there as well.",
17348,"I am very much committed to engaging non-academic audiences in my work as collaborators, too.",
17349,"I frequently collaborate with nongovernmental organisations, independent research and education institutions, arts and culture institutions, and professional organisations whose work relates to ecology.",
17350,The first reason concerns clarifying the relationship between the politics of ecology and all other burning issues of socio-political significance.,
17351,Those in power around the world now by and large acknowledge that ours is a historical juncture where climate change and environmental disasters require urgent action.,
17352,"But when it comes to precisely how this action ought to be taken, they tend to resort to habit, effectively continuing business as usual but with a green hue.",
17353,"Doing so deepens racial, class-based, and gendered disadvantages that the systems dominating our world have inflicted.",
17354,Addressing the planetary ecological crisis facing us today is neither a luxury nor disconnected from other major socio-political problems.,
17355,Addressing these problems and addressing climate change are one and the same imperative.,
17356,That my research addresses them as such makes it societally important.,
17357,The second reason has to do with how I interweave questions around cultural expression with pragmatic and systemic concerns.,
17358,Research and thinking on the subjects I explore in my work have for far too long adhered to a distinction between soft and hard sciences.,
17359,Addressing systemic issues has been seen as the preserve of the “hard” while that which is particular and cultural has been considered the domain of the “soft.”,
17360,But the current historical juncture that has exposed the intimate links between violent histories and the politics of ecology requires us to work from the particular to arrive at the planetary and to consider cultural expression not only as a symbolic question but also for its systemic and pragmatic implications.,
17361,Violent histories have created epistemic and political hierarchies that have at worst seen certain lives as disposable and have at best cherry-picked aspects of marginalized communities’ ways of life as cultural particularities by extracting them from their socio-political contexts where they are charged with systemic and pragmatic significance.,
17362,"What is at stake in the imbrication of violent histories and the politics of ecology is therefore how life itself is understood and practiced—what could be more important to society than that!
",
17363,The human central nervous system has about 400 billion nerve connections.,
17364,"Due to genetic syndromes, the ways these manifest can be very different from person to person.",
17365,"In this episode of Doing the Research, educator Prof. Dr. André Zimpel talks about his research on diversity in “neurodiversity,” especially with regard attending to classroom lesson plans.",
17366,So-called neurotypical people without any specific neurological syndrome can grasp roughly 4 things at a time in 200 milliseconds—the standard testing interval.,
17367,"Experts speak of “chunks” that could be letters, numbers, or things.",
17368,"“Even the most complicated letters in our alphabet consist of no more than 4 lines, for example, ‘E’ or ‘W’,” according to Zimpel.",
17369,"Our society, like the classroom, is shaped in line with standard ways of perceiving.",
17370,"“No matter how well you prepare classroom lessons, if you don’t attract attention, it is all in vain.”",
17371,This is how Prof. André Zimpel summarizes his research.,
17372,"Together with his team, Zimpel studies neurodiversity, meaning changes in the central nervous system that are usually traceable to genetic defects.",
17373,They often have a direct impact on the way that neurodiverse pupils perceive things.,
17374,"People on the autism spectrum, for example, often perceive significantly more chunks and grasp differences that are irrelevant for neurotypical people.",
17375,"Children with Trisomy 21, on the other hand, can grasp only 2 chunks at a time, meaning that they perceive only the end of words.",
17376,"“If they are asked to say the word ‘Uni-ver-si-ty,’ they would say ‘si-ty’,” according to Zimpel.",
17377,The researchers are developing teaching methods and instruments such as the Mathildr app to help children with Trisomy 21 learn math.,
17378,These tools take special ways of perceiving into account and can thus significantly increase learning outcomes.,
17379,"“Neurodivergent people are different but completely right in the head,” Zimpel is quick to emphasize.",
17380,"The team’s findings, he explains, could help neurodiverse people learn throughout their lives.",
17381,"In the current episode of the podcast Bildungsschnack produced by the Faculty of Education, Zimpel talks about how research proceeds exactly, the special moments he has had, and how he advocates not only for research on prenatal diagnosis but also on improving the life quality of people affected.
",
17382,A team from the Department of Physics at Universität Hamburg has managed to measure the uptake of co-enzymes by individual human skill cells.,
17383,"In an interview, Prof. Dr. Florian Grüner and Dr. Theresa Staufer spoke about the methods applied and their potential for further development.",
17384,Florian Grüner:,
17385,"Our x-ray fluorescence imaging methods allow high resolution measurements of marked entities, such as individual cells or medications, to determine their distribution spatially as well as over time.",
17386,"There are many varied potential fields of application, ranging from pharmaceutical studies in the development of new medications, through the measuring the immune response in therapy and for chronic inflammatory diseases.",
17387,"Two key characteristics unique to these methods, described to as “multi-tracking” or “multi-scale imaging”, refer to the ability to both track multiple entities at the same time, and also to image them at different scales from whole body scans to individual cells.",
17388,"Theresa Staufer: The two main goals for developing these methods is to create more compact x-ray sources, and also to produce significantly larger detectors for measuring the emission of x-ray signals.",
17389,"Currently, the measurements are conducted using a synchrotron, that is, a big accelerator, and there are not many of those.",
17390,"That means we need much more compact sources, to further develop the methods in laboratories as well as later in clinical applications.",
17391,"The second goal addresses the special x-ray detectors currently available, whose surfaces can only detect a fraction of the spatial angle available, which limits its sensitivity for the time being, until larger-surface solutions can be found.",
17392,Florian Grüner:,
17393,Our working group is working closely with a range of cooperation partners not only from the world of research but also from the clinical field and from industry.,
17394,"In particular, this close collaboration with medical and pharmaceutical research corporations is essential to develop methods that allow us to glean data that we currently cannot capture and thus answer some open questions.",
17395,"In addition, we also have close contact with developers and manufacturers from a diverse range of x-ray sources to make the methods accessible to a broader user-base.",
17396,Theresa Staufer:,
17397,"In addition to application to individual cells, the methods may make a significant contribution to medications, for example, in cancer therapies and monitoring immune responses in cell therapy, as well as the early detection of tumors.",
17398,"The methods can also assist with online-diagnostics in therapy, and quantify the immune system response after radiation.",
17399,Florian Grüner:,
17400,The research center of Hamburg has the unique advantage that there are many experts under one roof.,
17401,"We can only push these methods forward with close cooperation between the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, researchers from the fields of organic chemistry, nanosciences, and physics from both Universität Hamburg and DESY.",
17402,"This is because the methods cannot be conducted without suitable markers and x-ray sources.
",
17403,"Every summer, farmers in the Amazonian basin light fires, to clear land for farming.",
17404,"Currently, there are thousands of forest fires that are burning out of control.",
17405,"Brazilian researcher Debora Ferriera Pestana, a doctoral graduate of Universität Hamburg, explains why the forest is so important as a carbon sink and source of rainfall, and how its destruction could result in widespread desertification.",
17406,"The Amazonian rainforest is the largest forest in the world, and immensely important for the climate.",
17407,"This is for two reasons: Firstly, its biomass stores the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in its biomass, which can be released into the atmosphere by fire, or decomposition.",
17408,"That whole enormous forest is estimated to contain 86 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is a quarter of all carbon dioxide on earth.",
17409,The wildfires this summer will release 220 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.,
17410,A comparison: The whole EU emits “only” four million tonnes of carbon dioxide.,
17411,"If the whole forest were to be destroyed, it would change the climate of the whole world.",
17412,We would probably then no longer be able to stop climate change.,
17413,A second element is the humidity that rainforests produce.,
17414,The trees absorb ground water from under the earth and release it through their leaves.,
17415,"The rain that results doesn’t just fall over the forest itself, but also over other regions in South and North America.",
17416,"If the forest were to disappear, partially or completely, it would change the rainfall patterns across the whole continent.",
17417,Researchers have calculated that the area south of the Amazonian basin may change to include more steppes or even deserts.,
17418,This oxygen is reabsorbed by the forest.,
17419,"In contrast to what most people think, it is the oceans and not the forests that are the lungs of the planet.",
17420,"They product about half of the oxygen the world needs, They still can, but soon this will no longer be the case.",
17421,"In Brazil, between 16 and 20 percent of the rainforest has already been destroyed.",
17422,Experts estimated the “point of no return” is somewhere between 25 and 40 percent.,
17423,"After that, the hydrological cycle of the forest will collapse.",
17424,"Also, the fertile soil gets washed or blown away, and young forests can’t grow in barren soil.",
17425,We also have to consider the loss of biodiversity.,
17426,"There is an unimaginable species diversity in the Amazon, with many species only existing in small areas.",
17427,"If these areas are destroyed, the “endemic species” will also disappear, a not a single person will notice.",
17428,The forest is burning because people set fire to it.,
17429,It needs to be said straight-up there are not natural fires in a rainforest.,
17430,"Farmers cut down the trees, let the cleared area dry and when it is, set fire to it to open space for farming cattle and planting soy beans.",
17431,"Sometimes they announce these activities publicly, like the “Day of Fire” on 10 August, when dozens of fires were set.",
17432,That is not legal.,
17433,A large part of the rainforest is protected by law.,
17434,There are laws that apply all over Brazil that nature should be protected.,
17435,"For example, farmers have to leave a certain percentage of their land in its original state, in the rainforest, 50 percent.",
17436,"The problem is, these laws are not enforced.",
17437,"The agricultural lobby is powerful, and there is a lot of corruption.",
17438,"During the election, President Jair Bolsonaro openly said that he wants to “develop” the rainforest and dispossess the indigenous population.",
17439,The farmers have understood that they do not have to worry about repurcussions if they break the law.,
17440,"In Brazil, people are slowly starting to change their thinking.",
17441,"The smoke from the forest fires can be seen as far away as the big cities in the south, 3000 km from the Amazon.",
17442,"This has shocked people, along with the international outcry against the destruction of nature.",
17443,Brazilian agriculture depends on its export markets.,
17444,"If Europeans stop buying Brazilian beef or soy products from the rainforest areas, the farmers would have to change their behavior.",
17445,"Sadly, no,
",
17446,"For the second time, Universität Hamburg has awarded 4 fellowships to outstanding early career researchers, including the legal scholar Dr. Ekaterina Antsygina.",
17447,Antsygina is studying the gaps and loopholes in the protection of cold water corals and other sedentary species on the ocean’s floor.,
17448,Who is permitted to exploit hidden raw materials on the ocean floor?,
17449,"To whom do fish, shellfish, and corals belong?",
17450,And who decides whether to allow fishing in certain regions or to establish a protected area for flora and fauna?,
17451,"“The latter question has not been answered for all maritime zones,” explains legal scholar Dr. Ekaterina Antsygina.",
17452,“Every coastal nation is free to exploit and conserve all of the resources within 200 nautical miles.,
17453,"Beyond that, however, it gets tricky, especially for sedentary organisms such as corals and sponges.”",
17454,"Generally, the rights and obligations of coastal nations are governed by a complex network of international agreements.",
17455,"Beyond the 200 nautical miles zone, the waters belong to the high seas, where all nations enjoy freedom of navigation and fishing, but coastal states can assert rights over the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles if their landmasses continue into the sea.",
17456,"In this case, the country has exclusive exploration and exploitation rights for the living and non-living resources of the shelf.",
17457,"The country is therefore allowed to exploit the mineral resources, but not the fish stocks, because the fish do not live on the shelf, but swim in international waters.",
17458,"The situation is uncertain for sedentary species, who live immobile on or under the seabed or can move only slowly, always attached to the seabed (for example, sponges).",
17459,These organisms are extremely important for the ecosystem but may be quickly destroyed by trawling nets.,
17460,Yet international law does not clarify whether a coastal state can impose protection regulations to conserve them beyond 200 nautical miles.,
17461,This is the conclusion that Antsygina drew in her earlier work.,
17462,"With the funding, Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence has now enabled Antsygina to spend the next 3 years focusing on this gap in the law of the sea.",
17463,She aims to develop recommendations for coastal nations with regard to navigating this uncertainty.,
17464,"To do this, she will look at how 8 fishing nations have handled the problem, as lawyers and jurists often look at so-called customary law when the treaty provision is unclear.",
17465,"She will look at her native country of Russia, countries such as Canada and the United States—where she has lived and worked—and Japan, Norway, and Portugal, among others.",
17466,The Faculty of Law at Universität Hamburg is supporting her work.,
17467,"The law of the sea and international law are two of the faculty’s focal areas, while Law in Global Contexts is one of the University’s emerging fields and thus one of the areas that should ideally become one of its core research areas or even its own cluster of excellence.",
17468,The newly created Postdoctoral Fellowships funding program supports outstanding early career researchers from Germany and abroad working at the University who wish to prepare for the next stage of their career.,
17469,This can involve leading an early career researcher group or an appointment as a junior professor.,
17470,"They receive a substantial budget for materials: €20,000 annually for a 3-year period.",
17471,"Funding comes from the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.

17472,Glacier Kwong from Hong Kong is currently doing her doctorate at the University of Hamburg.,
17473,"Kwong previously demonstrated for democracy in her homeland; today, she remains involved primarily online in exile in Hamburg.",
17474,"In this interview, she explains how academic work differs between Hamburg and Hong Kong and why the topic of data protection is so important to her.",
17475,I had been to Hamburg once before and find the city to be incredibly beautiful—at least when the sun shines every now and again!,
17476,"Also, Universität Hamburg—in cooperation with the Europa-Kolleg—offers the European and European Legal Studies degree program, which was an ideal fit for me, since I am extremely interested in European data protection.",
17477,The atmosphere in the University is completely different.,
17478,"In Hong Kong, we are ultimately trained to become examination machines.",
17479,"There, it is simply about sitting through lectures, passing examinations, earning a degree, and getting a good job.",
17480,"In Hong Kong, professors simply press ahead with their lectures, clicking through PowerPoint slides.",
17481,Many people are not interested in discussing things we have just learned or what we talked about.,
17482,"In Germany, it is different.",
17483,"Here, we have the opportunity to discuss things.",
17484,"We can disagree with a professor, and the professor will readily engage in a discussion with us.",
17485,I have the feeling that students in Germany are not afraid of making mistakes.,
17486,"They can say what they think, and others might say, “It is interesting, that you think that, but I have a different opinion.”",
17487,"Data protection and digital rights are extremely important to me, because it was an underappreciated topic in Hong Kong for a long time.",
17488,There are many activists who fight for different political goals.,
17489,But no one thought about the future of digital rights.,
17490,This is why I campaigned for this in Hong Kong at that time.,
17491,"From that, I developed an interest in data protection and decided that I had to learn more.",
17492,"After completing my master’s degree, I took the decision to write my doctoral dissertation.",
17493,I am very passionate about this topic.,
17494,"It may come across as boring and even nerdy, but I am really interested in it.",
17495,"Primarily, it focuses on the legal theory of data protection.",
17496,We live in a world of commercial and state surveillance.,
17497,"This new reality demands that we examine the concept of private data and, if required, amend the substantive basis that we use in European law and in many places across the world.",
17498,It is a legal theoretical study on how the way we view and handle private data is changing.,
17499,"To be honest, it is really difficult to find a balance.",
17500,"Sometimes, I feel like I am in a parallel universe: I might be thinking about what is going on in Hong Kong and, at the same time, trying to get my shopping done and write my doctoral dissertation.",
17501,I often try to limit my activist work or delegate certain tasks to others.,
17502,The time difference in particular does not make it easy.,
17503,Many of my friends are journalists.,
17504,"Without press freedom, society would be a really bad place, because there would be no one to hold the government to account.",
17505,The press is society’s fourth estate and has the unparalleled role of informing the public.,
17506,"In Germany, the criticisms and debates regarding the role of journalists are—in my opinion—healthy, because there is a space to have this discourse.",
17507,"I am a little bit jealous of this, because, in Hong Kong, journalists are seen as activists for simply doing their job.",
17508,"In Hong Kong, in order to be able to have discussions at all, we need a free press first.",
17509,"Unfortunately, that is currently not the case.",
17510,"On the one hand, I want to continue as a political activist.",
17511,"At the moment, I am very involved in the digital world: giving interviews, writing articles, and giving speeches.",
17512,I also call for demonstrations and fight there for more democracy in Hong Kong.,
17513,I want to continue doing that.,
17514,"On the other hand, I can well imagine working for an NGO that focuses on Hong Kong or data protection.",
17515,"Writing my doctoral dissertation is not only about knowledge of data protection but also about the way of thinking and a critical approach to laws, politics, and society.",
17516,"That would help me in my work for an NGO that is involved in such issues.

17517,Prof. Dr. Stefano Panzeri has joined Universität Hamburg as a nucleus professor.,
17518,"With its calls for applications for these professorships, the University aims to attract leading researchers and to advance the development of emerging fields, such as Neurosciences and Cognitive Systems.",
17519,The application calls for nucleus professorships (nucleus is Latin for “kernel”) are being advertised within the scope of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.,
17520,I research how the nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other.,
17521,"These nerve cells, or neurons, communicate with each other by emitting small pulses of electricity akin to Morse code used in telegraphs.",
17522,"However, we do not yet understand how this works, because we do not know what language or code neurons use to talk to each other.",
17523,"As a mathematical neuroscientist, I develop algorithms to listen to neurons and crack their code.",
17524,"In addition, it is important to have close contact with researchers who are doing clinical experiments.",
17525,I do basic research.,
17526,But the reason I do this research is for application purposes.,
17527,"Being able to talk with the nervous system, either by capturing its information or by writing new information into it, is key to finding new ways to cure problems of the nervous system.",
17528,"If we understood the code used by nerve cells, we could target nerve cells to send out certain impulses and communicate as desired.",
17529,"So we could help someone if, for example, a peripheral organ—say the retina—is damaged but the brain is intact.",
17530,"This may sound like science fiction, but we could restore a person’s vision by bypassing the retina and sending images directly to the visual cortex.",
17531,I would like to use the special opportunities provided by this position to contribute to intensifying cooperation between researchers based in laboratories and those involved in clinical research.,
17532,"A lot of knowledge about the brain has been gained in laboratories by studying cells; however, it is not always easy to understand what impact the cellular mechanisms discovered have on the function the brain as a whole or on the behavior of clinic patients.",
17533,Computational models are great tools for uniting these two levels.,
17534,Not the weather!,
17535,"Hamburg, and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in particular, is one of the best places in Europe for both laboratory and clinical neuroscience.",
17536,This unique double strength provides an ideal environment for my research goals.,

17544,At the Hamburger Horizonte 2021 conference series “Please Turn the Page!”,
17545,"researchers and the public will discuss whether and how such transformations can be steered, whether basic changes in habit are possible, and individual responsibility.",

17557,"Universität Hamburg is using the Transfer@UHH fund to support 6 new research projects, including a project at the Center of Natural History (CeNak) on wildlife and the transmission of infection from animals to humans.",
17558,The project is being coordinated by the evolutionary biologist Prof. Dr. Matthias Glaubrecht.,
17559,"In this project, CeNak will illuminate Hamburg’s role in the illegal wild animal trade and, together with its cooperation partners, develop methods to identify and deal with crime related to species protection.",
17560,"Another goal, against the backdrop of the corona pandemic, is to analyze the relationship between the spread of viruses such as COVID-19, the wild animal trade, and the destruction of biodiversity and to increase public awareness of these important issues in nature and species conservation.",
17561,CeNak will contribute its scientific expertise in the field of biodiversity research.,
17562,"For example, we are planning educational programs on species diversity and wild animal trade for schools and customs workers as well as for the interested public.",
17563,"Concretely, we want to strengthen cooperation between CeNak and customs.",
17564,"In addition to identifying illegally traded wild animals, CeNak is helping customs and Hamburg conservation authorities with the molecular genetic analysis of wild animals.",
17565,"This way we can determine the origins and genealogy of confiscated wild animals, for example using DNA barcoding, and compare them with a database of DNA specimens.",
17566,"DNA barcoding makes it easier, for example, to determine the species of animal material that cannot otherwise or precisely be specified, for example, the meat, fur remnants, or eggs of exotic species.",
17567,"The funding will run from 15 November 2020 to 14 November 2021 and we will receive €50,000.",
17568,To build and expand a reference database on wild animals and comparative DNA specimens.,
17569,"We will also develop a communication plan on the topic of wild animal trade, mainly for staff at the customs agency but also for schools and the interested public.",
17570,"For the exhibition at the Zoological Museum, we will develop media on the topic of zoonoses— infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice-versa.",
17571,"It’s disturbing that the global wildlife trade has now become a billion-dollar business in which there are greater profits to be had than, for example, in the drug trade.",
17572,"At the same time, the continuing loss of wildlife is dramatic, due not least to hunting and poaching, which have decimated so many species, from elephants, rhinos, and tigers to pangolins and tortoises.",
17573,"This first became really clear to me when I was doing research for my recently published book on the end of evolution and human agency in species destruction, Das Ende der Evolution.",
17574,Der Mensch und die Vernichtung der Arten.,
17575,"It’s also clear that, after Frankfurt, Hamburg, with its harbor and airport, is a revolving door for illegal, but mostly unchecked trade with wildlife and its products.",
17576,This is why we are taking concrete steps in this project to improve these checks.,
17577,We also want to try to inform people about how wildlife trade and the destruction of natural habitats are connected to pandemics such as the current one.,
17578,The project aims to fight species conservation crime and thus to protect wildlife in nature.,
17579,"In view of the increasing danger posed by the transmission of infectious diseases by animals, the analysis of the wildlife trade in Hamburg will fill gaps in data and information.",
17580,"Furthermore, Hamburg institutions can use CeNak’s expertise and infrastructure, such as DNA barcoding, to clearly ascertain the wild animals and wild animal products confiscated by customs in line with species protection law.",
17581,A planned manual on handling and and taking specimens can be used nationally by everyone working in the trade of especially protected species.,
17582,And the reference database will be accessible to Hamburg institutions and institutions throughout northern Germany.,
17583,"Concretely in Hamburg, institutions will be able to professionalize their work by networking.",
17584,We will support customs with our expertise and the public will have an opportunity to inform itself comprehensively in the exhibition at the Zoological Museum and at events as well as to ask specialists questions.,
17585,We will develop formats specifically for schools.,
17586,"Via Universität Hamburg’s FUNDus! portal, experts and laypeople alike can gain an overview of the wild animals that have made it to Hamburg’s shores.",
17587,"Thanks to cooperation between the research institution CeNak, the Ministry of Environment and Energy’s department for international species conservation, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, expertise will be consolidated in Hamburg and the conditions ripe for a future specialist center in the field of wildlife trade and zoonoses.",
17588,"In the summer of 2020, CeNak had already taken up the topic of zooneses in a special presentation and this will now be integrated into the exhibition.",
17589,The Transfer@UHH fund is financed through the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments.,

17597,"However, one by no means trivial matter must be taken into account: on the one hand, digitalization saves resources—when business trips are replaced by online meetings, for instance.",
17598,"On the other hand, however, power consumption increases due to the computer processes.",
17599,Hardly anyone is aware of these dimensions.,
17600,"According to estimates, by 2030 IT will be responsible for one fifth of the world’s energy consumption.",
17601,The situation is particularly acute when it comes to artificial intelligence.,
17602,"The life cycle assessment for the development of voice recognition assistants like Siri and Alexa is far worse than it is for a car over its entire service life, for instance.",
17603,We must keep this in sight.,
17604,"It is often the case that smart, sustainable solutions are actually only even possible thanks to digitalization.",
17605,"A good example here is the development of a circular economy, so circular value creation that moves away from the model of “develop new things, use them, then throw them away.”",
17606,"To enable devices to be used for longer and repaired or recycled instead of replaced, digital solutions are needed to track the life cycle of products and to also be able to set incentives for action—both for companies and end customers.",
17607,A great deal has already been achieved in this field and especially young entrepreneurs strive to pursue such approaches.,
17608,"Among other things, I supported a group that developed a digitally supported reusable packaging system for food delivery and takeaway services that proved a huge success.",
17609,Digitalization is usually deemed purely an IT concern.,
17610,But only considering certain aspects of information technology is far too short-sighted.,
17611,"To find sound sustainable solutions, you need an interdisciplinary approach involving cooperation among researchers from a range of different fields.",
17612,"Economists have long had to concern themselves with IT—indeed, hardly a company can manage without it today.",
17613,"And since I have always taken an interdisciplinary approach in my work as a consequence, I see it as my job to identify the different issues and to bring researchers together accordingly.",
17614,Just take the current debate on the digitalization of schools.,
17615,Having enough computers to use is of course an important prerequisite for the success of the homeschooling of school students.,
17616,But this is just one step—and probably not even the most important one.,
17617,Providing school students and schools with devices is not enough.,
17618,"For homeschooling to work, countless other aspects must also be considered.",
17619,"How can knowledge be imparted online, for example, or does the traditional allocation of time for lessons still make sense?",
17620,How do learning processes that take place at home rather than at school look?,
17621,"When, how, and where do children experience optimal learning situations—and how can the potential new time allocations for digital teaching be implemented in a family-friendly and pedagogically effective manner?",
17622,"Such considerations can lead to very fundamental questions, for instance about performance evaluation systems.",
17623,And computer scientists cannot answer such questions.,
17624,"Rather, sociologists and learning researchers must work together with computer scientists and countless others to find answers.",
17625,The nucleus professorships are intended to encourage the development of important research topics.,
17626,"For me, it is above all about linking the topic of “digitalization” with other existing or new issues being researched at the University.",
17627,"I am also committed to the bilateral knowledge exchange—from the university to society, but also from society back to the university.",
17628,Which issues play a role in the Hamburg region and how can digitalization help with these?,
17629,I would also like young entrepreneurs to receive greater support from the University and am therefore involved in the Transfer Committee as well as in the development and supervision of the Management Transfer Lab.,
17630,"The Faculty of Business Administration (Hamburg Business School) is setting up this lab to give students interested in innovation and in starting a company somewhere to go at the University to learn and apply the necessary expertise.
",
17631,"Since 1 December 2022, Prof. Dr. Henrik Sattler has been the new dean of the Faculty of Business Administration (Hamburg Business School).",
17632,"In the interview below, he talks about his goals, responsibilities, and the advantages of his long-standing experience.",
17633,Prof. Dr. Henrik Sattler:,
17634,The topic of governance plays a central role in the imminent EQUIS accreditation process.,
17635,"It is vital to the success of the accreditation to have long-term leadership, in which the dean is always available and steers the diverse strategic processes of change in the long term.",
17636,Successful EQUIS accreditation is the central goal of my tenure.,
17637,The greatest challenge is the internationalization of our faculty.,
17638,"While in the area of research we have a very well-established network of leading international universities and also substantial cooperation with many international corporations, our teaching has thus far been limited with regard to internationalism.",
17639,But that will change.,
17640,"For example, starting in Summer Semester 2024, we are converting much of the main master’s program to English.",
17641,"We are also establishing international summer school programs and there are double degree programs currently running, for example, with Kyoto and Buenos Aires.",
17642,"We would also like to make communication processes within and outside the faculty more transparent and to motivate as many people as possible, based on their individual talents and interests, to constructively guide the faculty across the board.",
17643,"The leadership tasks that I had, for example, as spokesperson for the German Research Foundation research group Marketing of Hedonic Media Products in the Age of Digital Social Media: How Social Media Changes Marketing, certainly help me perform my duties as dean.",
17644,And my diverse responsibilities in academic self-governance as well as teaching and research help me keep in touch with the daily business of being a professor or administrator.,
17645,"I will continue to head the Institute of Marketing but due to time constraints, I will also delegate many responsibilities.",
17646,My job as spokesperson for the above-mentioned German Research Foundation research group ends this year.,
17647,That fits well with the start of my job as dean.,
17648,"To continue with the research group, we are currently preparing a grant application for a German Research Foundation collaborative research center that would be centrally connected to the University’s profile initiative Marketing and Communication.",
17649,"The dean’s job prevents me from continuing as spokesperson for this, but I will continue to actively follow the initiative. 
",
17650,Universität Hamburg applied to the second funding line of the Excellence Competition of the Federal and State Governments for 24 projects.,
17651,It now has more than €60 million available to implement these projects.,
17652,"Dr. Ariane Neumann, head of Department 1: University Strategy, explains how the ExStra projects are coming along.",
17653,The Excellence Strategy section ensures that all projects are implemented in accordance with their submitted project proposal.,
17654,The section works with the Executive University Board and numerous areas of the University and the administration in a type of project team and maintain an overview of what’s going on with the projects.,
17655,"They ensure that scholarships or development funds are announced punctually, that the 9 nucleus professorships in the emerging fields can be funded, and that institutions receive funding, such as the Hamburg Center for Health Economics for the continuation of its coronavirus research, which has been the subject of media interest around the world.",
17656,"At the same time, the section sees to it that the University, funders, and the general public learn more about the new things happening at Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence and what is being funded.",
17657,"Here, we will be unveiling some new information formats with the public relations team in the near future.",
17658,It sounds like a pretty exciting field and a great team.,
17659,It’s unbelievable how quickly time has flown since the funding decision was announced in July 2019 and also since funding began in November 2019.,
17660,We’re delighted that the majority of the projects are well under way.,
17661,"In some cases, we were already able to announce and award funding for innovative research or transfer for the second or third time.",
17662,We can see how much our success in the Excellence Strategy has put us in the spotlight by our ability to attract new researchers from all over the world since March 2020 despite the coronavirus pandemic.,
17663,"Since the announcement of our Excellence status, we’ve noticed a lot of support within and outside the University and from Hamburg and also a bit of pride among the University members to belong to one of Germany’s Universities of Excellence and to research, teach, and work here.",
17664,"In the previous year, Universität Hamburg celebrated its 100th anniversary on campus and throughout the city (even on the Alster!), and then came the decision in the Excellence Strategy—both gave the University a boost, which is still noticeable in many areas despite the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic.",
17665,"Many researchers are seizing the opportunities afforded by the University’s new status and the additional funding and the implementation of the projects that these opportunities offer, for example, by establishing new degree programs together with foreign partner universities like Kyoto University in Japan or by scouting new top-level researchers from around the world who have become curious about Universität Hamburg since last year.",
17666,"The fact that lots of University members have uploaded a picture of the Main Building with the red Excellence “e” as their background for videoconferences in MS Teams and Zoom is surely a good sign of how strongly connected they feel to the University, right?",
17667,"I’m happy every day working together with the amazing team in Department 1.
",
17668,"Today, the Joint Science Conference (Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz, GWK) decided to merge the Center of Natural History (CeNak) at Universität Hamburg and the Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig in Bonn.",
17669,"At the beginning of 2021, they should form a new Leibniz institute for the analysis of the evolution of biodiversity.",
17670,"Yes, Hamburg will get an innovative research museum in the field of natural history.",
17671,"Today’s decision clears the way, and further steps are already being drafted.",
17672,"Now, the project has to be incorporated into Hamburg’s budget.",
17673,"At the same time, we need to move forward in the next 2 years with concrete plans for the location and construction.",
17674,We are planning an international architectural competition and are already working on a scenographic concept.,
17675,"Ideally, we will have a new museum building in 6 to 7 years, where something like the proposed Evolutioneum will be housed.",
17676,"Yes, of course!",
17677,Because the University’s valuable natural history collections are in no way being lost!,
17678,"In the future, they will be suitably housed and much better handled.",
17679,"The study of biodiversity will be closely linked with the University, especially via the professorships that will continue to be situated at Universität Hamburg.",
17680,"The Leibniz institute for the analysis of the evolution of biodiversity will become Germany’s third-largest research museum, in which extant collections and key research areas in Hamburg and Bonn will complement one another wonderfully and will be further developed.",
17681,"We Hamburgers will be bring our impressive, large collections along, while our colleagues in Bonn will contribute their expertise in molecular and genetic biodiversity research.",
17682,"Moreover, with the Evolutioneum, we will finally create a showcase for the science concerned with the disappearance of species and species evolution—one of the most significant issues of the twenty-first century.",
17683,"At its core, the new Leibniz institute to analyze the evolution of biodiversity will consist of 3 research centers and 1 transfer center—each of which will have offices in both Hamburg and Bonn.",
17684,These centers will all focus on our joint key research areas.,
17685,"Of course, coordination and communication will pose a challenge.",
17686,"But thanks to the possibilities that we all have had a chance to test on a daily basis in recent months, I am confident that it will work—like in big companies with several locations.
",
17687,"Thunderstorms create cold regions that can lead to new thunderstorms Computer simulations can depict the effect, but what does it look like in nature?",
17688,A research team at Universität Hamburg and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is now hot on the trail of this real-world phenomenon.,
17689,It has over 100 measuring stations throughout the whole of Hamburg.,
17690,"There are 3 ingredients: warm and humid air above Earth’s surface, the right temperatures at higher altitudes, and a catalyst.",
17691,"The first ingredient, warm and humid air above Earth’s surface, appears above all in summer when the sun heats up the ground.",
17692,"When this happens, a lot of water evaporates.",
17693,The warm summer air absorbs this water and leads to typically humid weather.,
17694,The temperature decrease at high altitudes—the second ingredient—creates a barrier.,
17695,"In a thunderstorm situation, the barrier is not as pronounced as usual, which is why humid air can penetrate it.",
17696,"The third ingredient, the catalyst, is usually a random gust of wind.",
17697,This lifts a humid package of air upwards through the barrier.,
17698,"Once the package arrives, the humidity condenses, which means that the water vapor cools down and drops form.",
17699,"A cloud forms that, thanks to the release of evaporative heat, can develop into a high-reaching, dark thundercloud.",
17700,The exciting thing about these clouds is that the falling rain can trigger the next generation of thunderstorms.,
17701,So thunderstorms could increase!,
17702,"Via “cold pools,” which you could translate as “cold air lakes.”",
17703,"Cold pools form because rain evaporates as it falls, cooling the surrounding air.",
17704,Cold air is heavy and flows downwards.,
17705,"Thus, on the ground, a “lake” of cold air forms beneath the precipitation region and it flows outwards in all directions, just like water that someone pours on a flat plane.",
17706,"If this heavy, cold air from the cold pool meets the humid air on the ground, it slips beneath the humid air and lifts the ground air.",
17707,"Then the whole thing starts over again: humid, warm air rises and a new thunderstorm forms.",
17708,We use meters that we developed ourselves and that are attached to a pole 3 meters high; they measure the air temperature and air pressure every second.,
17709,Standard weather stations record these measurements only every 10 minutes—far too seldom for quick cold pools that spread to the tune of 50 km per hour.,
17710,"Normally, the meters also stand far too far apart.",
17711,It is only with our tightly-knit network of 100 stations that we can prevent a cold pool from escaping.,
17712,This is new!,
17713,We have been studying cold pools in high-resolution computer simulations for a long time now.,
17714,They are beautiful to watch in these computer animations and they have exciting effects that we understand quite well.,
17715,But do they reflect reality?,
17716,Do real cold pools really look like the cold pools on a computer?,
17717,"We are studying this now, with more stations than any research team has ever used before.",
17718,"With the help of our measurements, we can improve weather and climate models.",
17719,"The data can thus also help us make more precise thunderstorm warnings, meaning if, when, and where they are likely to occur.",
17720,"And they help us answer questions about mid- and long-term climate changes, especially for extreme weather phenomena such as downpours and thunderstorms.",
17721,"Cold pools are just small cogs in the vast climate system, but they steer important aspects of our weather and climate.",
17722,Yes.,
17723,We wanted to set up our network of stations southeast of Berlin as part of a large measuring campaign at the Deutscher Wetterdienst observatory.,
17724,The corona pandemic threw a wrench into the works.,
17725,We had to respond quickly and we shifted the campaign at short notice to home office.,
17726,"In the last few weeks, the meters were built in Hamburg and the surrounding region, in private gardens or on city premises.",
17727,Dr. Felix Ament is a professor at Universität Hamburg’s Institute of Meteorology.,
17728,He works on the development of weather and climate models at the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN).,
17729,"He heads the Messkampagne FESST@HH, in which researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology are also involved.",
17730,"The Deutscher Wetterdienst is funding the project to the tune of roughly €1 million.
",
17731,The fast-track program at Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence provides outstanding students with an opportunity to do a doctorate directly after completing their bachelor’s program.,
17732,"Maya Herrscher, from the Department of Informatics, is one of the students being funded through the program.",
17733,IT security is a topic that already grabbed Maya Herrscher’s attention when she took part in an IT project at school.,
17734,“I am fascinated by codes and cryptography—that doesn’t just mean encrypting information but information security in general.,
17735,So I focus on designing information systems that can resist manipulation and unauthorized reading.”,
17736,Herrscher wrote her bachelor’s thesis on this topic and her dissertation will also focus on the issue.,
17737,"She has already started her dissertation, directly upon the heels of her bachelor’s studies.",
17738,This is possible thanks to the University’s fast-track program.,
17739,"Students pursuing a bachelor’s degree in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Humanities; or the Faculty of Education are eligible to apply.",
17740,"If you are chosen for the 2-year funding program, you can pursue your master’s and doctorate at the same time.",
17741,"“For me, it’s a great opportunity despite the double burden,” says Herrscher, who has been receiving funding since Winter Semester 2022.",
17742,She was motivated to apply on the one hand by her supervising professor and on the other by her interest in the topics that she can examine more closely for her doctorate.,
17743,“I would like to research how different building blocks that ensure IT security can interact.,
17744,"Encrypting is only the best-known technique; beyond that, there are many other possibilities for transferring and processing data.",
17745,"How you combine these to use the various possibilities offered by the various building blocks is incredibly exciting to me,” she explains.",
17746,"Maya Herrscher will receive €1,300 monthly until the summer of 2024.",
17747,"Subsequently, she would like to complete her doctorate as a research associate at Universität Hamburg.",
17748,"“My dream is to work in academia in the long term,” she says.",
17749,“Because I can conduct basic research here and devote my energies to questions important to the future without having to orient my research interests to the immediate needs of industry.”,
17750,The fast-track scholarship was created within the framework of the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments at Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence.,
17751,"There are calls for applications once annually. 
",
17752,The Universität Hamburg “UHH global app” is now available for free download from the App Store and Google Play Store.,
17753,The English-language app is another Universität Hamburg service aimed at international users to provide quick access to key information and services at the university.,
17754,"“What courses and exchange programs are there, and how can I apply?”, “What visa do I need and how do I find an apartment?”, “What opportunities do I have once I finish my PhD and what funding programs are there for academic staff?”—”UHH global” is aimed at international students and prospective students, international researchers and international visiting scholars.",
17755,"The “Topics” section provides information on the most important issues.
",
17756,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
17757,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17758,This time: Linguist Prof. Dr. Nadja Kerschhofer-Puhalo.,
17759,"Prof. Dr. Nadja Kerschhofer-Puhalo, previously from the University of Vienna, joined Universität Hamburg in Winter Semester 2022/23 and will fill the professorship for German linguistics with a focus on written linguistics at the Institute for German Language and Literature.",
17760,"I see written linguistics as cross-cutting, concerned with the structure, use, acquisition, and development of writing and literariness.",
17761,"Researching the acquisition of written language, the history of writing and writing systems, and “literacies” with regard to the practice of reading and writing in social contexts is an interdisciplinary undertaking.",
17762,"It requires consolidating contributions from psycholinguistics; descriptive, historical, and contrastive linguistics; textual linguistics and discourse research.",
17763,"It also involves education science, multilingualism research, literary studies, media studies, and, last but not least, practical implementation in teacher training.",
17764,"In line with citizen science and participatory research, I actively include children, adolescents, and adults in my research projects to center their perspectives and realities as readers, writers, and learners.",
17765,"Thanks to their participation, we gain a much more multifaceted idea of the nature of reading, writing, and learning, and how learning difficulties arise but can also be surmounted.",
17766,"Simply put, I am concerned with everything related to writing and written language.",
17767,I have to say that my children and my family sensitized me to many of the questions that I now work on in my research: What happens in these (such fleeting) moments in which “the light goes on” in a child’s head and it can connect the sequence of letters to make sounds and thus read?,
17768,What do we need to pay attention to when someone learns to read in a new language or another writing system?,
17769,How do writing and reading in digital contexts differ from “standard” reading and writing activities?,
17770,"What does it mean in our society to “master writing” (or not to master it, that is, be illiterate)?",
17771,Above all: How can we address reading and writing difficulties and what does that mean for advanced and continuing education for teachers?,
17772,Universität Hamburg is the first university to establish a professorship for written linguistics and it is an incredible privilege to fill the position.,
17773,"In the last few weeks and months, I have had contact to many of my new colleagues and I am really delighted with the openness and warmth I have experienced.",
17774,"I really do not know the city of Hamburg and I very much look forward to discovering it because, geographically and historically, it provides a very interesting contrast to Vienna, where I lived and worked.",
17775,"Above all, cooperation with my colleagues from various institutions and faculties is important to me.",
17776,"I see especially the Center for Linguistics (ZfS), with its various areas of cooperation, as providing interesting infrastructure for joint projects, for example, a lecture series on the history of writing, or interdisciplinary projects on writing and literacy.",
17777,"With regard to acquiring literacy and fostering reading, I would especially like to work together with colleagues from various areas in education, for example early childhood and primary education, adult education, and subject-specific didactics to consolidate linguistic, pedagogical, and didactic research perspectives.",
17778,"As in my previous work, in Hamburg I will also seek dialog with non-university educational institutions in the field of adult education and non-profit organizations in order to research literality in non-school contexts.",
17779,I would like to use a participatory and co-creative research approach again.,
17780,"I am also very excited about work in the Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts, because I originally studied ancient Near Eastern studies and I have a special fondness for historical literary objects.",
17781,"I am especially interested in aspects of the materiality of written work in relation to languages, writing systems, and the historical and cultural contexts of past eras.",
17782,"One of my current favorite topics is the status of writing by hand, because the age of digital technologies does not bode well for this—although from my point of view, there are interesting processes of usage diversification that I would like to look at more closely.",
17783,And I am especially looking forward to the invitation to participate in a subproject on literacy narratives in the planned collaborative research center on literacy in diversity contexts.,
17784,"In my lectures, I like to show the relevance and added value of linguistic approaches to better learning and teaching processes.",
17785,"I rely on current research findings, practical examples from my own projects (texts, pictures, videos), and on my past experience and students’ interests.",
17786,Learning means making connections between the new and the familiar.,
17787,This succeeds above all when I know more about my students and their experiences.,
17788,"It is especially important to me to make students less afraid of linguistics, which, with its extensive theoretical apparatus, can scare people off at first glance; but precisely in the field of applied linguistics, the discipline has a lot to offer in the way of opening up alternative academic approaches to everyday experiences with writing, language(s), and linguistic and social diversity.",
17789,"I have international contact with colleagues in France, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland.",
17790,Important topics include multilingualism and sociolinguistics.,
17791,"I would like to further expand upon my contacts to universities in Great Britain, where there is intensive research on literacy studies and literality and multimodality.",
17792,"To better establish the field of written linguistics, I would also like to pursue cooperation in the German-speaking world, for example with the Universities of Zurich and Vienna, where questions in written linguistics are being addressed from different perspectives.",
17793,"Everyone has a fundamental right to learn how to read and write and to have access to sufficient learning and education resources, regardless of background or social status.",
17794,"To me, this is one of the most important bases for a self-determined life, for a democratic society, for resilience in crises, and for individual and social learning processes that contribute to the creation of a sustainable future.",
17795,"For this, we need sound research, and classroom, curricular, and school-based organizational measures on the basis of current research and an open dialog between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners; between universities, schools, and other educational institutions, and between learners and teachers.",
17796,"I am really looking forward to shaping this dialog in my professorship at Universität Hamburg.
",
17797,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
17798,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17799,Prof. Dr. Anne Lauscher is joining the Faculty of Business Administration (Hamburg Business School) in winter semester as Professor of Data Science in Business Administration/Informatics.,
17800,"Previously, she was at Università Commerciale Luigi Bocconi in Milan, Italy.",
17801,"In the field of data science, I research artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to understand and generate natural language texts (epsecially with a focus on conversation and argumentation).",
17802,"It’s important here for AI in a classic sense to function well, meaning that it can solve the problem posed to it; it should also, however, do justice to ethical concerns.",
17803,"For example, does AI have racist or sexist tendencies or can we shape AI models with greater energy efficiency?",
17804,The question is “How can we and how do we want to shape communication in the future?”,
17805,"Hamburg is well-known as the “pearl of the north,” and there is so much to discover!",
17806,"So I am looking forward to the city’s variety of cultural opportunities, for example, at the Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Elbphilharmonie.",
17807,"I am also a big foodie, and Hamburg can also be proud of itself in this area—let me just say: Franzbrötchen (note: a Hamburg delicacy similar to a cinnamon bun).",
17808,"Of course, I am especially excited about the University, which, as one of Germany’s universities of excellence and the largest university in northern Germany is especially diverse and inspiring.",
17809,"At Universität Hamburg, I will advance basic research in the area of automatized communication.",
17810,"To do so, I will build a strong research group that focuses as holistically as possible on AI processing of natural language.",
17811,I am also convinced that it takes collaboration and multiple perspectives to shape automatized communication usefully for society.,
17812,"For this, I will be collaborating with researchers from various disciplines and faculties.",
17813,Data science methods are the basis of modern AI systems.,
17814,"That is not only incredibly exciting, it is also becoming a part of all areas of life.",
17815,"For example, I am certain that the majority of students at Universität Hamburg have interacted at some point with a personal voice assistant (e.g., via a smartphone).",
17816,"Today, these kinds of systems are usually based on machine learning methods for the automated processing of language and text.",
17817,"Thus, I can only recommend that everybody considers these topics at some point.",
17818,"In the last 5 years, I have collaborated with about 60 other researchers from universities, industry, and other research institutions.",
17819,"They include, for example, members of the University of Cambridge, New York University, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Michigan, Grammarly Inc., and, above, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle.",
17820,"In Germany, Europe, and many other regions of the world, AI is seen as a key technology.",
17821,Our society believes in AI and that AI will transform our society.,
17822,It’s exciting to discover new areas in which AI can create added societal value: can chat bots moderate political debates to ensure plurality?,
17823,"Here, in my opinion, it is vital to shape these systems so that they truly have social value and do not just replicate hegemonic and conservative viewpoints or, though they may be fair and functional, their high use of energy damages the climate.",
17824,"This is why I research not only effective but also inclusive, fair, and sustainable AI technologies.
",
17825,"22 June 2022, by Kulmus / editors Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
17826,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17827,"This time, we are introducing educational scientist Prof. Dr. Claudia Kulmus.",
17828,Prof. Dr. Claudia Kulmus left Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin to join Universität Hamburg.,
17829,"In June, she began her junior professorship for adult education at the Faculty of Education.",
17830,"What primarily drives me is the question as to how we can become a society characterized by longevity and, accordingly, life-long learning.",
17831,"This requires research on learning among older adults and their interests, both in educational institutions and in their everyday and social lives.",
17832,This is also a political topic—namely the question as to what a society in which we do not assign “old people” a special role might look like.,
17833,We need infrastructure that also facilitates social participation and recognition later in life.,
17834,I am also interested in professional teaching work and in the program planning and organizational design of adult education.,
17835,"For beyond these professional activities, we support adult learning and look for ways to support those who of course learn—for we are all always learning—but who cannot easily figure out how to pursue continuing education.",
17836,"Concretely, I am currently working on a project on senior citizens in the pandemic in which I look at the long-term, and also positive, consequences the pandemic might have for educational and social institutions—in addition to all the negative aspects that have impacted older people themselves as well as educational and social institutions in the pandemic.",
17837,"People learn throughout their entire lives, always anew, always something different.",
17838,All people can learn until a very advanced age but not everyone has the same conditions and possibilities to do so.,
17839,"Furthermore, there are many prejudices with regard to learning, especially for older people, and we are trying to look at that more closely and when and how people learn “life-long and broadly;” what the necessary conditions are; and also which support, which educational opportunities, and what kind of advice could help.",
17840,"Among other things, I am driven by the vision of a society devoted to longevity and life-long learning.",
17841,"If we could achieve that, gaps in our (career) biographies would not be so dramatic, and not just for older people but also for younger people because there would always be visible and acceptable ways to re-orient yourself even in old age; to develop further, to try out new areas of activity and enjoy social recognition.",
17842,"And the knowledge, experience, and perhaps even the wisdom of older people should be made more visible both within and outside of conventional employment.",
17843,I see teaching as common work on topics that I approach anew each time together with my students.,
17844,"As an educator for adults, I also try to make my own intentions and thoughts with regard to the seminar or lecture as transparent and comprehensible as possible.",
17845,This makes cooperation possible and it can also allow for individual interests and development in my seminars.,
17846,"This usually works more or less well—at the least, it is what I hope for.",
17847,"I would like my projects in participation and career research to contribute to life-long learning through old age and to make an impact in the field of education and, above all, adult education.",
17848,"Learning does not end when employment or family obligations do, and the ability to learn most certainly does not.",
17849,"As a teacher, I would like to further develop a system of theory-practice-reflection.",
17850,"This is also important to me because at the university, it is mostly about practicing how to think and work academically, and sometimes you can get the impression that this is neither practical nor helpful.",
17851,"I see that completely differently, but the relationship between theory and practice and making their mutual “usefulness” visible requires systematic reflection.",
17852,We need space for this in teaching.,
17853,"I am just now getting involved in the most various of networks for research on aging—the topic, of course, is also being looked at internationally and from an interdisciplinary perspective.",
17854,"For example, I have made contact, also at conferences, in Finland, England, and Canada.",
17855,I was in Denmark as part of a teaching exchange and we had a guest researcher from Hungary.,
17856,"Furthermore, in Hamburg there is the UIL, the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.",
17857,"That is actually predestined for questions about supporting learning into old age, which I would very much like to get to know and to see if there are possibilities for cooperation.",
17858,The Alster—I have already found my favorite bench for short breaks right near my office—and the traditional “Moin” greeting; my colleagues and the possibilities for developing and shaping academic work.,
17859,"See the Faculty of Education websitefor an in-depth interview with Prof. Dr. Kulmus.
",
17860,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
17861,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17862,This time: Literary scholar Prof. Dr. Daniel Fliege Prof. Dr. Daniel Fliege came to Hamburg in Winter Semester 2022/23 from the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin to take up the Professorship for Romance Studies with a focus on Italian and French Literature in the Faculty of Humanities.,
17863,"My research addresses, as is usual in romance studies, two completely different areas: on the one hand, I am working with how contemporary cultural models were taken up and reformulated in spiritual literature in the early modern period.",
17864,"I am also researching what is known as the “littérature du sida,” that is, poetry, particularly autobiographical and autofictional poetry written in French about HIV/AIDS since the mid-1980s that deals with the relationship between HIV—infections / AIDS as a disease and the presentation of one’s (own) (homo)sexuality.",
17865,It is important for me that my research can also be understood by non-academics.,
17866,"Put very simply, my initial focus is exploring how spiritual literature from the sixteenth and seventeenth century was influenced by non-religious model texts and authors.",
17867,"So, for example, the poet Mageurite de Navarre rewrote secular love poetry to express her faith.",
17868,"Otherwise, I work with texts where people who have contracted HIV and/or AIDS write about their own (homo)sexuality.",
17869,"In this I am particularly interested in how the infection or illness has changed their relationship with their own bodies and others, and their sexuality in general.",
17870,"I love how open Hamburg is, and the people who live here, as well as how the canals and parks open it up geographically.",
17871,"They provide space to catch your breath and to let your thoughts run free, as well as providing an openness to diversity: Hamburg is an incredibly colorful and dynamic city, and I am looking forward to participating in the cultural life of the Hanseatic city.",
17872,"In the coming semesters, I want to begin a recurring lecture series under the Hamburg Open Lectures title, to present subjects to more than just the academic public, but in which academics can open up a dialog with members of the general public.",
17873,It should center around subjects suited to interdisciplinary discussion.,
17874,"In my lectures, students can look forward to interesting topics, for which I read artifacts in their historical context, but also always try to create a link to the reality of daily life.",
17875,"In addition to literary texts, I also bring in other art forms, particularly visual arts and film.",
17876,"That’s because current cultural theories help enrich my seminars, particularly in the fields of gender and queer studies and post-colonialism.",
17877,"I am currently working particularly closely with French colleagues in Paris ( Sorbonne, and Paris Nanterre), and we are researching how Petrarchism is changing across cultural and linguistic boundaries.",
17878,"I am also working closely with Romance linguistics at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, examining post Tridentine hagiography in France.",
17879,"My research is important, particularly for the early modern period, as I often research authors who have been long forgotten and neglected.",
17880,"Taking a longer-term view, I hope my work can contribute to expanding the literary canon.
",
17881,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
17882,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17883,This time: education scholar Prof. Dr. Freydis Vogel Prof. Dr. Freydis Vogel joined Universität Hamburg in summer following her tenure at the University of Nottingham; she is a professor of digitalization in education at the Faculty of Education.,
17884,The research topics I am working on are influenced by my interest in cooperative learning with digital technologies.,
17885,"Above all, the question arises as to how and under what circumstances cooperative learning can be successful or problems solved together that require the interplay of different, individual abilities.",
17886,Digital technologies come into play here in different ways.,
17887,"On the one hand, we are talking about the development of digital technologies that support cooperation, direct communication, or inspire activities that foster learning.",
17888,"On the other, in the rapidly changing digital world, new technologies are constantly being developed that require learners and teachers to keep learning new skills, for example, thanks to changing forms of communication.",
17889,"In most cases, I am the one interested in the experiences my conversation partners have had with learning using digital technologies.",
17890,"And because my research has close connections to their everyday lives, we quickly get to their use of digital technologies such as MS Teams, Moodle, email, or TikTok and their various experiences with cooperative learning.",
17891,"Then I explain that there are many advantages to working with others to learn or solve problems, for example, that it is more fun or that you can support one another.",
17892,"This doesn’t always work well, however, and thus, I research which aids can best help learning groups reach their goals.",
17893,"I am especially interested in how digital programs on computers, tablets, or smartphones can be used sensibly when learning.",
17894,I conduct primarily quasi-experimental studies to compare the effects of different learning scenarios.,
17895,"In addition to individual learning successes in pre- and post-tests, I intensively analyze process data on the interactions between learners.",
17896,"Furthermore, I conduct meta-analyses in my research areas to gain a better overview of the currently available evidence on learning with digital technologies.",
17897,"Even if digitalization in the field of education has potential, there are ever-changing challenges when improving processes and offering solutions.",
17898,"And at least since the ubiquitous use of online learning during the pandemic and the public access to AI thanks to programs such as ChatGPT, the challenges linked to digitalization, especially in the field of education, have taken center stage.     ",
17899,I am really looking forward to welcoming new students in my classes who are interested in the topics of digitalization and education.,
17900,I give clear insights into my own research and the projects of cooperation partners beyond Hamburg’s borders.,
17901,"I am also really interested in topics that the students themselves are passionate about and in my classes, I support and guide students in their efforts to achieve their individual learning goals.",
17902,"As we can no longer conceive of education processes without digitalization, I can only recommend that all students in the Faculty of Education take advantage of my courses to explore the possibilities of digital technologies in education and to reflect critically upon the associated challenges.",
17903,"In the field of digitalization in education in particular, I would like to strengthen the position of the Faculty of Education at Universität Hamburg.",
17904,"Above all, this should be possible through good networks with other faculties and institutions that can contribute their own specific views and expertise on the topic of digitalization.",
17905,Interdisciplinary exchange lets us develop new approaches to digitalization that the faculty can implement and try out for education.,
17906,"Thanks to my previous work abroad and my involvement in international scholarly communities, for example, as a coordinator in the European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction, I have a wide-ranging network.",
17907,"Thanks to my time in Great Britain, I work with colleagues at the University of Nottingham and the University of Cambridge.",
17908,"In Japan, I am currently intensifying cooperation with colleagues at Senshu University and Shizuoka University.",
17909,"I am also working with researchers in the United States who are working, for example, at Indiana University Bloomington and Penn State University.",
17910,"Thanks to my involvement in the International Society of the Learning Sciences, I have a large number of international contacts to researchers who are primarily concerned with research on teaching and learning with digital technologies.",
17911,"So far, I have seen Hamburg only on trips and the city has always fascinated me, especially the harbor, the many cultural activities, the changing weather, the straightforwardness, openness, and diversity of the people I have met.",
17912,"I am now looking forward to being a part of that and to encountering at the University and among my colleagues and students the things that also fascinate me.
",
17913,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
17914,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17915,"Prof. Dr. Iris Kesternich came to Hamburg after working at the Belgian university KU Leuven and has been working in the Department of Economics in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences since 1 July 2022.",
17916,She took over the nucleus professorship for economics with a focus on empirical health economics and will be a core member of the Hamburg Center for Health Economics.,
17917,"My research focuses on health, work, and behavioral economics.",
17918,I am especially interested in how non-monetary incentives impact health and labor markets.,
17919,Examples of such incentives are professional norms or the meaningfulness of work.,
17920,"Among other things, I am interested in what motivates people to work.",
17921,"In the field of medicine, professional norms, such as the Hippocratic Oath, are important.",
17922,"Furthermore, the meaningfulness of the work plays an important role.",
17923,What does this mean for salary demands?,
17924,Are people prepared to forgo their salaries if they can contribute positively to society with their work?,
17925,Or would they rather be paid better if their work makes an important contribution?,
17926,I always try to use the methods that best suit the respective line of inquiry.,
17927,"I like to collect my own data and combine that with various types of data:surveys, experiments, historical, and administrative data.",
17928,"At the moment, I am eagerly awaiting my new data from the Netherlands.",
17929,"At the University, I am most looking forward to nice colleagues and my new team.",
17930,I think it’s great that Hamburg is so big and green and that there is so much water.,
17931,I also look forward to big city life.,
17932,I hope to go to the opera again soon.,
17933,It is especially important to me to work on further improving the conditions for excellent research in Hamburg.,
17934,My dream would be to attract the brightest minds from all over the world to Hamburg so that together we can answer the really exciting and important questions.,
17935,Because they will learn to use data to find answers to politically relevant questions.,
17936,I was a resident visitor at the RAND Corporation for a long time—one of the world’s most famous think tanks.,
17937,"My co-authors work in, among other places, Innsbruck, Leuven, London, Los Angeles, and Tilburg.",
17938,"Unfortunately, with 2 small children and an exciting job, I have no time for hobbies (except, perhaps, for watching the children’s TV program Sendung mit dem Elefanten.)",
17939,"In the field of work economics, my current projects contribute to finding out what we can do to address the current dearth of labor on the one hand and long-term unemployment on the other.",
17940,I also research how we can reduce differences between men and women on the labor market and within the family.,
17941,"In the field of nursing care, I am interested in how we can shape this in the future and what role non-profits and private homes can play.
",
17942,"Every year, numerous new researchers join Universität Hamburg.",
17943,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17944,"This time, we introduce Prof. Dr. Jana Kleibert.",
17945,"Prof. Dr. Jana Kleibert has been a professor of economic and social geography, with a focus on urban research, in the Department of Earth System Sciences at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences as well as at the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) since September 2022.",
17946,I research different aspects of globalization such as global supply chains or transnational companies and organizations in the knowledge economy.,
17947,"Currently, I am heading a research project that takes an economic and urban geography approach to the international location choice of universities and the emergence of so-called “education hubs” in large cities.",
17948,"We look at how university branch locations are embedded in transnational flows of students, teachers, knowledge, and capital and at their role in urban and national development strategies.",
17949,"Mostly, I provide examples of my concrete research: Why does the University of Nottingham have a foreign campus in Malaysia and China in which even individual buildings have been reconstructed?",
17950,What does the University of Lancaster now have a new campus in Leipzig?,
17951,Everyone begins immediately to think about it and are then eager to learn about my field research findings.,
17952,Hamburg is a pleasantly green big city with the port and the University acting as gateways to the world.,
17953,This means a lot of new possibilities for further globalization and urban research.,
17954,I am also looking forward to exchange with students and the cooperation with my new colleagues at the Institute of Geography.,
17955,"Economic geography is often very topical and it takes current developments, whether Brexit or Bitcoins, into consideration.",
17956,"Together, we take a critical look at everyday economic processes and connections and gain a more nuanced view of the world.",
17957,I am starting off with a big trip to Amsterdam.,
17958,That will definitely be an adventure and educational experience!,
17959,"I don’t only research the internationalization of universities; as an academic, I am also, of course, part of the international research community.",
17960,"I did my doctorate at the University of Amsterdam and I was a visiting scholar at the Universities of Manchester, Vancouver, and Singapore.",
17961,"Currently, I am working with researchers from Great Britain, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany.",
17962,"Globalization research is currently becoming relevant again due to global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and war.",
17963,The question about the risks of global networking and economic dependencies has now become drastic.,
17964,Are we facing the end of globalization?,
17965,"My research critically probes the internationalization and marketing of higher education, which is an essential part of the knowledge economy.
",
17966,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes several new researchers.",
17967,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
17968,"This time, we introduce linguist Prof. Dr. Lars Vorberger.",
17969,Prof. Dr. Lars Vorberger started his Professorship for German Linguistics at Universität Hamburg in winter semester.,
17970,"Prior to that, he worked at the University’s Equal Opportunity Unit, where he was responsible for the diversity section.",
17971,"As part of my professorship, I would like to focus my research on the complex relationships between language and sexuality and gender.",
17972,"We talk about queer and gender linguistics, meaning, for example: How are these identities linguistically constituted?",
17973,How do ideas about sexuality and gender affect our language?,
17974,"And, vice-versa: How does language affect our ideas?",
17975,"I want to focus especially on the auditory level, meaning phonetics and phonology, which in turn has a connection to research on regional languages, which had previously been my main area and in which I want to continue my research.",
17976,"In addition, the research area of language and sexuality yields further exciting points of contact, for example, to forensic linguistics, psychology, sociology, or education science.",
17977,I often imitate Hape Kerkeling’s parody “Gay man at a café.”,
17978,"I normally don’t have to wait for a reaction and it’s a great starting point: people laugh, my imitation or rather Kerkeling’s parody has thus successfully provided a concept of “gay pronunciation.”",
17979,That means there is a socially shared concept about how gay men stereotypically speak.,
17980,"In Germany, this has seldom been researched.",
17981,"Interestingly, there are differences between languages: In German, previous findings reveal a (de)nasal pronunciation, in English, however, a lisp.",
17982,"This, in turn, impacts the view of sexual identities, which seem to be culture-bound.",
17983,This was one example of a line of inquiry.,
17984,"Others focus on, for example, how sexual identities are presented in the media or what impact feminine nouns or feminine forms such as “die Memme,” “die Bürgerin,” “Schwester” (“sissy,” “citizen,” “sister”) or universal terms such as “Feuerwehrleute” (“firefighters”) have on us.",
17985,"Of course, I already live in Hamburg and I know Universität Hamburg—I completed my bachelor’s at the Institute for German Language and Literature and worked in the Equal Opportunity Unit.",
17986,"So for me, it feels more like a return.",
17987,I feel a very close connection to the city.,
17988,"Even though I am Hessian at heart, Hamburg is my adopted home.",
17989,"I got to know the University differently, from an administrative perspective, in my equal opportunity work, which is no doubt helpful.",
17990,"For this reason, I am familiar with the sound research and teaching conditions at the University and the Faculty of Humanities and I am looking forward to the cooperation with colleagues and students.",
17991,I would like to continue discovering the research area of language and sexuality and to establish it within the German university landscape at Universität Hamburg.,
17992,"There is not much research in this field, contrary to the English-language landscape.",
17993,It concerns current and relevant social topics that I want to handle in my courses and that I want to transmit to society at large.,
17994,"Furthermore, there are exciting points of contact to existing research in different subjects at the University—the research field lives from its immanent interdisciplinarity and the job is to tap into that.",
17995,"First, my courses concern what is, for Germans, a quite new research field, opening up numerous possibilities: there is much to research and discover.",
17996,I would like to pursue these together with my students and also let them oversee their own small empirical research projects.,
17997,"Furthermore, there are, as said, very topical lines of inquiry that, among other things, can be very important for teacher training students but that all of us can understand because sexuality and gender are nearly omnipresent.",
17998,I hope that my huge interest and my enthusiasm for the research field will inspire my students.,
17999,"So far, I had—due to my focus on the regional languages of Germany—no international cooperation.",
18000,"But I do have contacts, especially in the United States, but also in Sweden.",
18001,I would like to intensify this exchange.,
18002,"The research field is not only interdisciplinary but international, so that a comparison with other languages and cultures seems promising.",
18003,"Gender-neutral and diversity-sensitive language, which is also part of my research and teaching, is immediately socially relevant.",
18004,"The topic is still being intensively discussed and it is socially controversial, so previous and future findings can be enlightening.",
18005,"And the research on the relationship between language and sexuality can have important social consequences: greater linguistic knowledge about sexuality and sexual and gender identities, for example, on the construction of personality, cultural connection, linguistic mechanisms, or stereotypes, advances understanding.",
18006,"At best, it can reduce prejudice and discrimination while advancing diversity, which seems in the actual discourse on gender and sexuality more urgent than ever.
",
18007,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
18008,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
18009,"This time: Chemist Prof. Dr. Maria Buchweitz Prof. Dr. Maria Buchweitz switched from the University of Stuttgart to Hamburg in April and is now a W2 professor for food chemistry in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences.",
18010,"I work on the classic topics in food chemistry, meaning the qualitative and quantitative analyses of food ingredients.",
18011,"I am also interested in the interaction of different food ingredients during processing, ingesting, and digesting.",
18012,"For example, if you bite into or cut an apple, then you destroy its cells.",
18013,Substances that did not previously have contact now do and can interact.,
18014,This can lead to various reactions.,
18015,"This is especially easy to observe, for example, when the fruit turns brown, especially in traditional types of apples.",
18016,"And when, for example, we concern ourselves with the health aspects of food, we often use simplified model food and measure biomarkers in blood, urine, or tissue.",
18017,Yet what actually happens in our bodies during digestion we don’t really know.,
18018,"Our research is an effort to unravel the mystery—one the one hand, by using clinical studies to gain greater understanding of the effects of food ingredients, and on the other to yield information about which concrete foods would be best for clinical studies to investigate the health-relevant aspects.",
18019,"Let’s take, for example, type 2 diabetes, a disease affecting more and more adolescents and young adults and with numerous food-related causes.",
18020,"When you develop this disease, there are increased spikes in sugar or “hyperglycemia” following a meal.",
18021,"There are already studies in which some ingredients, for example secondary plant compounds, inhibit the activity of digestive enzymes such as amylase and glucosidase in the small intestine but also react with starch when processed and thus reduce digestibility.",
18022,"Both lead to lower or slower glucose absorption in the blood, thus avoiding spikes in blood sugar.",
18023,That’s right.,
18024,"Using various methods in the lab, we study substances that inhibit enzyme activity and are released from complex compounds when ingesting and digesting, and which concrete structural properties are responsible for the greatest possible reduction in enzyme activity.",
18025,We are also looking at which processing conditions will reduce the digestibility of starches when interacting with other food substances.,
18026,"As a rule, we look at plant foods—the apple I mentioned before is an especially good model.",
18027,"Here, we looked at the concrete interaction between secondary plant compounds and the allergen Mal d I.",
18028,This is the allergen that takes the blame for people who allegedly have a stronger allergic reaction to commercial apples than to traditional apples.,
18029,We looked at this and discovered that traditional apples at first seem to have lower allergen content and that the storage times and conditions strongly impact the number of allergens.,
18030,"Our findings and methods would now be suitable for clinical studies to determine in oral allergy tests what the connection is between allergen content, secondary plant compounds, and allergy potential.",
18031,That is exactly the point: we need to know the limits of our own research.,
18032,We are the people who make inquiries at an analytical level.,
18033,"Interdisciplinary questions, however, always have to be answered within the team.",
18034,So we are looking for partners who can conduct these clinical studies with us.,
18035,This will most certainly be a project that we continue to pursue.,
18036,At the moment we are modernizing our lab facilities and applying for equipment grants.,
18037,"Among other things, we want to procure a surface plasma resonance spectrometer to analyze the interactions between various biomolecules more precisely.",
18038,We have also applied for a new mass spectrometer to identify and quantify food substances.,
18039,We are well-placed for further projects and cooperation focusing on interactions between food matrices and bioactive molecules.,
18040,"First, I will be taking over my predecessor’s courses as tradition dictates.",
18041,"Next year, the degree program will also go through an accreditation procedure and that is a good time to think about modernization and for discussion— because the basics that our students bring with them from their schooling change constantly, just like the profession.",
18042,"It is important that when studies end, we continue to send good food chemists off into the world who question the status quo, check, and always go a step further on the basis of facts.",
18043,"And I mean in the right direction, based on the experiences they have had in their studies here.",
18044,The safety and health benefits of food are important issues and the topic of many current debates.,
18045,Food chemists develop analytical methods to ensure food safety and to test processes and reactions.,
18046,"When, for example, we create protein extracts from plants to then create, among other things, new procedures for meat substitutes, then ingredients can react.",
18047,This can lead to changes in functional properties and physiological effects.,
18048,So we are not just talking about food monitoring but also about guiding new trend and product development.,
18049,"And those will continue to be exciting fields.
",
18050,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
18051,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
18052,This time: Psychologist Prof. Dr. Nicolas Schuck.,
18053,"Prof. Dr. Nicolas Schuck, previously from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, to start in the winter semester as professor for learning and change mechanisms with the Faculty of Psychology and Human Movement.",
18054,"As a cognitive neuroscientist, I research the neuronal mechanisms of learning and decision making.",
18055,"In particular, I am interested in an “algorithmic” approach, inspired by research into artificial intelligence (AI).",
18056,"For example, we are trying to find out where and by what rules the brain decides to store an experience in our memories.",
18057,People always say the brain is the most complex object in the universe.,
18058,What I find even more fascinating is the idea that this unimaginably complex brain is also constantly changing.,
18059,"And it is changing in a way that gives us special abilities, for example, effortlessly learning to speak as children.",
18060,But we don’t yet know how the brain does this.,
18061,That is what I want to find out.,
18062,"Universität Hamburg attracted me with its modern and global view of the future, and because of its strength in the field of psychology and neurosciences.",
18063,"I also like big cities, particularly those that are near the water.",
18064,That makes Hamburg hard to beat.,
18065,"My main goal is to further increase the interdisciplinary collaboration between psychology, neurosciences, and informatics/AI, and also to bring more life to the profile initiative Mechanisms of Change.",
18066,"As a learning researcher, it is particularly important to me that everyone gets ideas and knowledge from my lectures that will stay with them for a long time.",
18067,"That is why I try, whenever possible, to use practical examples and exercises to build practical skills.",
18068,I am in the very fortunate position of working with a lot of international colleagues.,
18069,"This includes people at Oxford, the University College London and Tokyo University.",
18070,Working to better understand how our brains “normally” work is done in the hope of finding something along the way that teaches us about psychological or neurological illnesses.,
18071,"We are also examining how aging influences learning processes, and how to differentiate between normal aging and dementia.
",
18072,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
18073,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
18074,"This time: Linguist and Iranian studies scholar Prof. Dr. Shervin Farridnejad, who, among other things, now strengthens the Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts In the summer semester, Prof. Dr. Shervin Farridnejad left Freie Universität Berlin and the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna to join the Faculty of Humanities, the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, and the Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts as a professor of Iranian studies and the history, language, and cultures of the Middle East.",
18075,"I focus primarily on the languages, religions, and written artefacts of Iranian-speaking peoples since Antiquity and their continuing impact into the present.",
18076,"I look especially at religious traditions in Zoroastrianism and Iranian Judaism, with a major focus on the spiritual and material culture of Zoroastrians and the Iranian and Persian-speaking Jews in Iran, Central Asia, and India as well as in the western diaspora.",
18077,"Concretely, I am currently working on a linguistic and religious study of the traditions in Zoroastrian literature in modern Persian between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries.",
18078,"At the same time, I am also interested in the history and society of the Persian-speaking world, which now extends far beyond the borders of today’s Iran and includes Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan up through India in the east and regions in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Iraq, and western Syria.",
18079,"Like a detective uncovering a mystery, I practice philology with a religious and historical focus at 3 levels—the manuscripts are the corpora delicti!",
18080,"First, I illuminate the material composition of the manuscripts and documents.",
18081,"Then, I examine their linguistic and literary features, meaning I have to decode, read, translate, and annotate them.",
18082,"On the basis of my discoveries, readings, translations, and collected facts, I reconstruct and explain the history of a text and thus the story of a specific religious or cultural society, or even an era.",
18083,"I am always interested in how we can revive or grasp an unknown, forgotten, or little-researched society or era based on literary and material cultural goods.",
18084,"In my first encounters, I already got to know people in Hamburg as open and polite and I immediately felt welcome.",
18085,I was also kindly welcomed by my colleagues at the University right away.,
18086,I anticipate a challenging and varied research and teaching environment at Universität Hamburg.,
18087,"I am looking forward to my work in the Faculty of Humanities and the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, where I see a lot of opportunity and potential for important scholarly cooperation.",
18088,"I am also looking forward to Hamburg’s culturally diverse and international landscape, Hamburg museums, theater, opera, and the Elbphilharmonie.",
18089,"With the Elbe and the Alster Lake, the proximity to water makes Hamburg something special for me!",
18090,"I grew up between different cultures and in this context, Hamburg strikes me as a very vibrant and colorful city where I can feel at home",
18091,and I am looking forward to discovering this kind of city.,
18092,I would like to more firmly establish Iranian studies in the Faculty of Humanities with my research.,
18093,"This includes lively activity at the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures and the Cluster of Excellence Understanding Written Artefacts, where I want to get involved with my many research interests, and network with a host of international researchers working on Iranian and Persian-speaking manuscript cultures.",
18094,"I would like to use my knowledge to offer my students a more diverse spectrum of subjects in the history, languages, religions, and culture of Iran and the Iranian-influenced landscape.",
18095,"As a teacher, I would like to impart to my students above all very sound scholarly methodology for understanding and analyzing challenges in the scholarly encounter with the “Orient” and its connections to their future work.",
18096,I find both professional and personal exchange with my students very inspiring and above all the special experience of learning together in a course.,
18097,Students can expect in my courses both classic philological exercises involving us working together to examine literary texts in minute detail and critical scrutiny of the way texts work and shape our culture and social phenomena.,
18098,"With regard to content, I would like to work out a systematic and scholarly way of thinking as a teacher by balancing theory and practice.",
18099,"My subject area focuses mostly on languages and written artefacts, history, society, and intellectual and material culture.",
18100,"Iranian studies in the German-speaking world originally primarily focused on philology, and there are good reasons for that.",
18101,"Nonetheless, I am convinced that today, we must integrate and apply methodological approaches and findings from other disciplines such as religious studies, the social sciences, law, literary studies, ethnology, and gender studies.",
18102,This will be an important topic especially for anyone interested in modern and contemporary Middle East research.,
18103,"In my courses, I try to interest students, for example, in how cultural and historical continuity and change in the old high cultures of the Middle East work in detail and how this knowledge from other geographical places and historical eras can help us better understand and explain fundamental questions today.",
18104,"Students should also learn how human beings aware of themselves and the world make decisions, handle problems and challenges, and how they behave in certain situations.",
18105,"My invitation to students is to critically probe central historical, social, and even spiritual questions about our subject together.",
18106,The special challenge posed by the humanities is to examine and question prevailing ways of thinking from new perspectives.,
18107,"That is exactly what I would like to impart in my teaching via Middle Eastern literature, history, and culture.",
18108,"In the past years and in my current projects I have already established many research contacts—throughout Europe, in Great Britain, and North America, but also in Iran and India—through which I regularly correspond with researchers and members of the Zoroastrian and Jewish communities.",
18109,"In addition to these research projects, there are also international and interdisciplinary publications, guest lectures, conferences, and summer school programs.",
18110,So it is especially important to me to initiate continued cooperation with international colleagues and to invite them to Hamburg.,
18111,"We can justifiably ask ourselves what studying old, distant, even “exotic” cultures can mean for life in Europe in the twenty-first century.",
18112,"My research could contribute, for example, to making the culture and history of the high cultures of the Middle East from Antiquity to the present—which have deeply influenced our own modern European culture—more understandable and tangible.",
18113,Many essential questions or incipient conflicts facing us today resemble the questions and conflicts facing people in “other” cultures.,
18114,"To understand ourselves, it is sometimes helpful to see ourselves in the mirror of other people.",
18115,I also hope that my research contributes to solving and allaying today’s social conflicts and that it helps us develop a clear language for the purpose of dialog.,
18116,"Iran and the world it has shaped, as important parts of the Middle East, are often deemed the “cradle of civilization” and they have been of central significance in the development of agriculture, art, cities, mathematics, science, and western religious traditions.",
18117,"The region gave rise to, among other things, the first settled villages and proto-urban settlements, the first written languages and manuscript cultures, monumental architecture, foreign trade, and centralized states.",
18118,"Following the emergence of Islam in the seventh century and the prevailing Islamic culture, the region nonetheless remained highly diverse with regard to language, religion, and ethnic identity.",
18119,"The scholarly approach to this diversity and the ambiguities that result should help us, ideally, to better shape the relationship between us and our society and the “others.”
",
18120,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
18121,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
18122,"This time, we meet business economist Prof. Dr. Sabine Neumann.",
18123,"In August 2022, Prof. Dr. Simone Neumann, previously at the Helmut Schmidt University—University of the Federal Armed Forces, joined Universität Hamburg as Professor of Business Administration, in particular Sustainable Logistics and Mobility Systems at the Faculty of Business Administration.",
18124,"I look at various questions in the fields of logistics and mobility, combining empirical research with operations research methods.",
18125,I particularly like to investigate real-world problems and apply scientific methods to develop improved solutions.,
18126,"Currently, for example, I am working on a research project to investigate the possibility of “crowdshopping,” i.e., private individuals do supermarket shopping for other people.",
18127,Imagine you have to deliver a truckload of packages to a huge range of addresses.,
18128,"Of course, you could just drive off to the recipients’ addresses in any order.",
18129,"But if you think carefully beforehand and maybe even calculate what order will ensure the shortest/fastest route, you can save a lot of time and/or expense.",
18130,"And if you now also think outside the box and consider innovative solutions, e.g., additional drivers who travel this way anyway; autonomous driving; the use of drones or public transport for delivery, etc. you might find sustainable solutions that save time, money, and/or also energy and emissions.",
18131,I find Hamburg a lively city.,
18132,"It’s just fun to discover it, to become inspired by its many different people and innovative projects and to be motivated to pursue new ideas and to shape the world around us.",
18133,"The University is a great place for this and with its many research groups and institutions, it offers unique possibilities, also for interdisciplinary research projects.",
18134,"I very much look forward to cooperation with my colleagues at the University, in the Faculty of Business Administration, and especially in operations and supply chain management.",
18135,My goal is to more strongly network the field of logistics through international and interdisciplinary research projects and to allow for synergy.,
18136,"I would like to build upon my existing networks, create new ones, and connect these to Universität Hamburg.",
18137,I also want to use the advantages that such cooperation brings with it for my students and to let them benefit from it.,
18138,"Operations research and getting to know solutions to questions in logistics are not only exciting, they also help us understand everyday problems and to see them from other perspectives.",
18139,"I handle a few of these problems, for example, in my lecture introducing graph theory.",
18140,I enjoy close cooperation with Western Norway University of Applied Sciences in Haugesund in Norway and the Ben-Gurion University in Be’er Scheva in Israel.,
18141,"In addition to cooperation in the corporate sector, I also have an extensive applied project with the Lufthansa Group.",
18142,There is plenty of untapped potential in the distribution of goods or transportation of people.,
18143,"Economically, ecologically, and socially, we would profit from organizing differently or from alternative types of transport and transport solutions.",
18144,"The goal of my research is, among other things, to study these possibilities (not just from economic but also from a societal perspective), and thus (I hope), to help shape sustainable, promising transport.
",
18145,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes numerous new researchers.",
18146,This series introduces them and their areas of research.,
18147,"Prof. Dr. Dominik Begerow, previously at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, has been working at the Institute of Plant Science and Microbiology in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences since 1 August 2022.",
18148,He is also the new director of the Loki Schmidt Garden.,
18149,My research focuses on fungi and their diverse interactions with plants.,
18150,"Plant parasites such as smut fungi depend on living host plants and in the course of evolution, they have developed a finely tuned infection mechanism that purposefully evades the plants’ own defense mechanisms.",
18151,"Using infection experiments and comparative genomics, we are trying to understand the mechanisms of the various species.",
18152,"To do so, we look especially at the processes of species development, hybridization, and co-evolution.",
18153,"For this, the focal program Taxon-Omics (SPP1991) will move from Bochum to Hamburg.",
18154,"We are also interested in the interaction between entire fungal communities and plants—at the root, on the leaves, or in the nectar and blossoms—that we characterize using meta-barcoding approaches.",
18155,This makes it increasingly clear that the plant microbiome can have a huge impact on the entire ecosystem.,
18156,"In Hamburg, we would especially like to analyze the role of fungal communities with regard to climate change.",
18157,"Over time, organisms change and become more or less common due to positive or negative features.",
18158,"It is not simply environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation that play a role, but also the interactions between species.",
18159,"For example, plant parasites can lead to plants producing less energy through photosynthesis and they also drain the plants of their energy.",
18160,"This is why plants defend themselves against parasites, but these are usually quicker and adapt to the defense mechanisms.",
18161,We are now studying the genetic code of parasites and comparing their adaptations to on another.,
18162,"This teaches us the parasites’ successful strategies and perhaps, in the future, we will understand how we can prepare the plants for possible changes.",
18163,"Using modern genetic methods, we can even analyze hundreds of different fungus species in a small habitat, for example, a leaf, and thus be able quickly to say something about changes due to environmental factors.",
18164,"For example, we could recently show that in different places in German forests, there are very different species.",
18165,"But when we look at what the fungi do in their respective locations, we see that in comparable forests, different fungi do exactly the same thing or the same enzymes are active.",
18166,This redundancy is probably especially significant for being able to respond to climate change and to ameliorate possible negative effects.,
18167,I am especially looking forward to my new colleagues in Hamburg.,
18168,There will certainly be opportunities for cooperation that combine our research interests.,
18169,I am equally happy about my new responsibilities as the director of the Loki Schmidt Garden.,
18170,There are also a lot of colleagues here with whom I’d like to further develop the garden to make the significance of the plants for the future of our planet more visible.,
18171,"In addition to research projects, I want above all to give the Loki Schmidt Garden a clear profile and to strengthen its importance for the University and Hamburg.",
18172,"Thanks to the industriousness of the staff, the garden is in fantastic condition.",
18173,"Together with the gardeners, I would like to better showcase Hamburg’s botanic collections because I am convinced that plant diversity is a central building block towards solving society’s future problems.",
18174,"The focus on useful plants, which has a long tradition here and, thanks to the Loki Schmidt House—Museum for Economic Plants is especially at home here, is something I am committed to.",
18175,We are not only dependent on plants for food; they will also play a larger role in medicine and biotechnology in the future.,
18176,"We want to bring that home to our colleagues, students, and the entire Hamburg public.",
18177,"The name of my department, \u200bOrganismic Botany and Mycology, makes clear that I will be focusing on the neglected group of fungi.",
18178,"In school and university curricula, they often play only a small role and yet they are endlessly important for our ecosystems.",
18179,They are ubiquitous and play a central role in the decay of organic material.,
18180,I invite my students in my classes to get to know these organisms better so that we can strengthen fungi research and better tap it in the future.,
18181,"Indeed, fungi are so special because there is still so much to discover: new species, new organelles, new agents, new metabolic pathways ...",
18182,"Genuine, curious explorers are always welcome.",
18183,"As a long-standing member of the executive board of the International Mycological Association, I am internationally connected as a researcher.",
18184,"We actively exchange with researchers from France, the United States, South Africa, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Belgium, China, Ecuador, Portugal, and other countries.",
18185,"International colleagues regularly visit and many of our final theses or doctoral dissertations are completed, in part, in other countries.",
18186,"Even if we primarily do research on the principles of the evolution and ecology of fungi-plant interactions, many application aspects motivate our research.",
18187,Climate change increasingly threatens our basic food resource and there has been essentially no research on the behavior of parasites and other interacting partners.,
18188,"When we better understand how microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi deal with changes and how they respond to them, perhaps we can develop sustainable solutions that do not lead to more problems.
",
18189,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
18190,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
18191,"This time: Prof. Dr. Hewan Semon Marye Prof. Dr. Hewan Semon Marye has been working in the Faculty of Humanities since Summer Semester 2023 as a Professor for „Äthiopistik, insbesondere Gegenwartsfragen Nordostafrikas“ I study the history of modern Ethiopia, a period spanning from the mid nineteenth century until contemporary times.",
18192,My research thus far has been about state and society relations.,
18193,"But I am now much more interested in the project of modernization the country embarked upon in the late nineteenth century and the various aspirations, deliberations and (im)practicalities of its implementation.",
18194,"I research and teach about the various challenges, changes and upheavals as well as the persisting questions that have plagued Ethiopia over the past two hundred years.",
18195,I ask what the political elite’s aspirations have been and what the various people’s demands and quests were.,
18196,Another question I’m interested in is to what extent the question of modernizing Ethiopia was genuine as a state-backed project; and what makes the question still of interest in contemporary times.,
18197,I also study in what ways inter-continental and international forces and aspirations affect internal aspirations.,
18198,"Besides the charm of the city of Hamburg, it is home to the internationally leading institution of Ethiopian and Eritrean studies, the HLCEES (Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies).",
18199,"Getting to work with individuals who are prolific for their expertise in Ethiopian and Eritrean history, philology, art history, political history and the like is one of the appeals of researching and teaching at Hamburg.",
18200,"I am also excited to be re-joining scholars of the Asia-Africa Institute as a colleague, where I was once a student doing my PhD.",
18201,"Though there is an already established centre that teaches and researches Ethiopian and Eritrean history, the HLCEES has predominantly focused on the late antique to medieval periods (with emphasis on manuscript traditions and philology).",
18202,I plan to teach and research about the modern period of the history of the region.,
18203,"This refers to the period starting with 1855 until contemporary times, and about topics ranging different cultures, religions, traditions, and various historical interpretations.",
18204,"Students interested will now have the option of studying, researching and working on this time period.",
18205,"I plan to give seminars which revolve around these three categories: 1) Empires, Nations, Governance, Encounters; 2) Cultures, Traditions, Ideas; 3) Economic and Social Justice, and Inequalities.",
18206,"In addition to learning about a country that boasts over a millennia long history with its own tradition of historical documentation and home to ancient religions and cultures, my courses will allow students to read about and study modern Ethiopia through a multi-disciplinary approach.",
18207,"They will provide students with a solid knowledge of history, socioeconomic studies, introduction to cultural phenomena, and the educational and legal traditions of countries of the Horn and Ethiopia and Eritrea in particular.",
18208,My undergraduate and graduate studies in the United States (Amherst College) and England (University of Oxford) have allowed me to cultivate research contacts with researchers and educators working in various ways on the African continent or particularly on Ethiopia.,
18209,The Anglo-Ethiopian Society is an example.,
18210,I also have contacts with specialists working on Ethiopia from Australia and France.,
18211,"My brief stay in Ethiopia after completing my Doctoral studies also allowed me to form connections with the Addis Ababa University, Bahir Dar University, Gondar University and Woldiya University.",
18212,I am keen to build upon these relationships by organizing conferences and working together on research projects.,
18213,I also intend to invite interested collaborators as guest lecturers.,
18214,This can be done via online platforms and can be beneficial to students while also making Universität Hamburg a point of connection for international researchers.,
18215,"Thanks to social media (internationally) and a radically ethnicized politics (internally, in Ethiopia) history is incredibly politicized.",
18216,"Part of my work and research on Ethiopian history is driven by the need to demonstrate that history should be studied with the utmost objectivity as the past is always, very, complicated.",
18217,I want to show that historical interpretations and debates should be done with care as the field of inquiry deserves minute attention to detail and a vast reserve of patience when dealing with characters and figures who are no longer here to speak for themselves and their actions.,
18218,"This might help students develop the necessary distance, patience and open-mindedness when studying the past; qualities that should be cultivated and allowed to grow in a time where sensationalizing (of many things in life) is mainstream.",
18219,"Beyond completions of projects and monographs started before getting to Hamburg, I have two major research plans I intend to begin while in Hamburg.",
18220,The first is working on the writings of the two early twentieth century Amharic newspapers.,
18221,"These are the አእምሮ Aʾǝmǝro ‘Knowledge’ and ብርሃንና ሰላም Bǝrhanǝnna sälam ‘Light and Peace’ newspapers, which contain prose writings, literary narrations and poetry.",
18222,"Predominantly, literate enthusiasts and intellectuals alike wrote about European style modernization and Ethiopia’s relationship with Europe.",
18223,Some even held debates about multiple processes of development.,
18224,"These publications also served as the actual forum for literary studies and criticism, and the development of the Amharic language as a mature medium of expression in these fields.",
18225,I plan to study the socio-cultural and intellectual context of the period from the contributions in the newspapers as well as to understand Ethiopian history through the questions and issues that preoccupied literate Ethiopians at the time.,
18226,"The second is writing the biography of Ras Mäkwännǝn, the father of the last emperor of Ethiopia, Emperor Ḫaylä Śǝllase I (r. 1930–1974).",
18227,"Ras Mäkwännǝn served as the right-hand man of Emperor Mǝnilik II (1844–1913), and as Ethiopia’s foreign minister at the time.",
18228,"He is remembered for his military expertise, knowledge of the country’s terrains, and his commanding of the forces of Ethiopia during the Battle of Adwa in 1896 which stands among his biggest achievements.",
18229,"He occupies a large space in Ethiopian political and military history, and in his undeniable role in shaping his son, the future emperor.",
18230,This is particularly salient when we observe how attracted his son was to Europe and his devoted attention to international affairs.,
18231,"However, besides a small book written about his life in Gǝ’ǝz, there are few other serious works dedicated to him and his history.",
18232,"Ras Mäkwännǝn’s biography has the ability to place this figure in historical discussions, while illuminating the social changes and thoughts of his time, the legal tradition at his court and Ethiopia, the early modern times of Ethiopia and its relationship with the West during his life.
",
18233,Postdoctoral Fellowships for outstanding early career researchers: Universität Hamburg—University of Excellence jas won funding for the third time.,
18234,"Philosopher and economist Dr. Colin von Negenborn wants to use the funding to find out how people can make sustainable and fair decisions, including about non-human actors.",
18235,I work at the interface of philosophy and economics.,
18236,That is interesting for me because philosophers ask sociopolitical questions that economics do not consider.,
18237,"On the other hand, economic methods, particularly those from mathematics and game theory from the field of macroeconomics, can enrich the study of philosophy.",
18238,"Our relationship with animals is well-suited to this research, because game theory approaches to ethics already exist, but have only been considered from an anthropocentric perspective.",
18239,"That means, until now, only those people who were actively involved were considered, even though animals are just as affected by human activity.",
18240,Game theory is a mathematical model which helps us to understand decision-making behavior in conflict situations.,
18241,It allows us to estimate the effects of a range of interactions on all players.,
18242,"As such, it brings the potential reactions of all players into consideration.",
18243,"In using this method, our goal is to identify desired activities, that is conduct that is ethical and fair in conflict situations.",
18244,Probably not.,
18245,But they are still affected by our behavior and adapt their own behavior accordingly.,
18246,"They move out of certain areas and range into new territories, just think about the wolves that have returned to Germany.",
18247,"They conquer new territory, come across new prey, and adapt their hunting techniques.",
18248,That makes them players according to game theory.,
18249,"The fact that they don’t strictly rationally assess their own behavior and thus don’t consciously decide on the most rational course of action, is irrelevant from a game theory perspective.",
18250,"At the end of the day, humans don’t always act as rationally as we would like to think we do.",
18251,"I have to say, the methods are very interesting for me, but of course it is not an end in itself.",
18252,"I also want to contribute to humans learning to better recognize and discuss the limits of the permissible, i.e., ethically acceptable behavior.",
18253,That affects our relationship with animals as well as other issues such as how we deal with future generations.,
18254,In my research project I also look at issues of generational justice.,
18255,"In terms of animals, I think that we need to fundamentally rethink how we interact with them.",
18256,"We have to learn to see them as players as well, and not only as objects on the playing field.",
18257,"If we can do that successfully, that will have a long-term impact on legislation, and the framing of laws, and I think that would be a good thing.",
18258,One thing I want to use it for is publication.,
18259,I am a huge fan of open-access publications that are free and accessible for the academic community.,
18260,But for authors that can go up to €2000 per publication really easily.,
18261,The funding will be a great help with this.,
18262,"I also want to hire a research assistant, attend conferences and workshops, and host an event of my own in the second or third year of my research.",
18263,"As a postdoctoral fellow at Universität Hamburg Dr. Colin von Negenborn leads the interdisciplinary research project Markets and Morals in the emerging field Grounds, Causes, Reasons.",
18264,"The project combines practical philosophy and theoretical microeconomics.
",
18265,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
18266,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
18267,"This time, we are introducing Prof. Dr. Aaron Butts.",
18268,"Prof. Dr. Aaron Butts came from the Catholic University of America (Washington, D.C.) and has been working in the Faculty of Humanities since 1 September 2022 as professor for Semitic Studies, especially Ethiopian Studies.",
18269,In 2022 he was awarded an ERC Consolidator Grant by the European Research Council and will receive almost 2 Million Euro for his research.,
18270,At Universität Hamburg he will closely collaborate with the Cluster of Excellence “Understanding Written Artefacts”.,
18271,"My research is concerned mainly with the Semitic languages of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, especially Ethiopic and Syriac.",
18272,"In addition to these languages, I am also interested in the texts that transmit these languages as well as the communities that wrote and copied these texts.",
18273,"In addition, I examine the historical context of Near Eastern Christian communities, including their interactions with each other and with Jews and Muslims.",
18274,"I devote most of my time and energy to working with texts, manuscripts, and inscriptions written in ancient Semitic languages.",
18275,"You will probably be familiar with modern Semitic languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, and maybe even Amharic spoken in modern-day Ethiopia, but I work primarily with ancient Semitic languages.",
18276,"Among the ancient Semitic languages, I specialize in two in particular.",
18277,One is called Ethiopic: Ethiopic is the ancient language used in the region that is now Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.,
18278,"Ethiopic is first attested in inscriptions from the first centuries of the Common Era, and it eventually developed into the literary and religious language of Ethiopian and Eritrean Christianity.",
18279,The other ancient Semitic language in which I specialize is Aramaic.,
18280,"Aramaic is perhaps best known as the language that Jesus and other first-century Jews spoke, but Aramaic’s history predates Jesus by a thousand years and continues until the present, in each period thriving in many different dialects.",
18281,I concentrate on one particular dialect of Aramaic that is called Syriac.,
18282,Both Ethiopic and Syriac are classical literary languages of Christian communities.,
18283,I work on the manuscripts and inscriptions of these communities with particular interest in studying their histories from the early centuries CE up through the medieval period.,
18284,"My move to the city of Hamburg and to Universität Hamburg presents me with many new opportunities, both personally and professionally.",
18285,"Personally, I am very happy that I am living in Europe, and in Germany in particular.",
18286,"I have quickly fallen in love with the city of Hamburg, which I find to be a lively international city with so much to offer to its residents, a quiet walk along the Alster, a spectacular performance at the Elbphilharmonie, an afternoon at Planten un Blomen, fabulous museums and seemingly endless cafes and restaurants ...",
18287,I feel fortunate to be living in Hamburg.,
18288,"Professionally, Universität Hamburg is among the best universities in Germany, and it is an especially good fit for my own profile.",
18289,"The Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies (HLCEES) at UHH is a global leader in the field of Ethiopian Studies, and I greatly look forward to contributing to its stellar program of teaching and research.",
18290,"In addition, Universität Hamburg is well known for its Cluster of Excellence “Understanding Written Artefacts”.",
18291,"This Cluster of Excellence is one of the main attractions that drew me to UHH, and I welcome the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in the cluster who are working on so many rich and diverse topics, from palimpsests to inscriptions, from graffiti to manuscripts.",
18292,"At Universität Hamburg, I plan to undertake my project “BeInf – Beyond Influence: The Connected Histories of Ethiopic and Syriac Christianity”, which is funded by an ERC Consolidator Grant.",
18293,"BeInf takes as its impetus a long-standing question in scholarship about so-called Syriac “influences” on Ethiopic Christianity, but to answer this question my project jettisons the conceptual frameworks of previous scholarship and instead aims to develop new ways of thinking about the connections, contacts, exchanges between Ethiopic and Syriac Christianity.",
18294,"In addition, BeInf adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that brings together methods traditionally disconnected, including art history, linguistics, manuscript studies, philology, textual studies, and history.",
18295,"In this way, my BeInf project is positioned to make significant, long-lasting contributions to the field Ethiopian Studies, both in content and in concept, while also serving as a paradigm-shifting model for other projects in the humanities addressing “connected histories” with all their nuance, complexity, and texture through a multi-disciplinary approach.",
18296,"More broadly, I plan to deepen UHH’s strengths in Ethiopian Studies, especially in Ethiopic language, literature, and manuscripts, within the context of the Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies as well as the department for African Languages and Ethiopian Studies.",
18297,"In addition, I aim to establish new strengths in Semitic Studies and the Study of the Christian Near East.",
18298,"I am particularly interested in developing Syriac studies and Christian Arabic studies, thereby giving a broader base for the Semitic languages of Late Antiquity and the various traditions of the Christian Near East.",
18299,My work in developing these new fields at UHH will present opportunities for collaboration with colleagues in Jewish studies and Islamic studies.,
18300,"I often begin each of my courses by stressing that my primary goal is to teach students how to read texts, as well as art and architecture, closely and carefully and with methodological, if not theoretical, sophistication.",
18301,"If you want to learn about different parts of the world, from the Middle East to the Horn of Africa, then my courses will be of interest to you, but even if you are not interested in these particular regions (or at least not yet!), still know that my courses aim to teach one of the most important skills in life: how to think critically, innovatively, and with self-reflection.",
18302,"In my courses, students will be encouraged – even required!",
18303,– to develop their own thoughts and perspectives as well as to express these in their own unique voices.,
18304,"Academia – and society more broadly – is in desperate need of new ideas, and through my teaching I aim to prepare students to participate in these conversations.",
18305,I will continue to collaborate with my many close colleagues in North America.,
18306,These are relationships that I am very much looking forward to leveraging in new ways now that I am based at Hamburg.,
18307,"In addition, I am excited about possibilities for new collaborations with colleagues in Europe that will be facilitated by closer geographic proximity: Up to this point in my career, I have established many connections with colleagues across Europe, but my collaboration with European colleagues has been strained by the reality of the physical distance that has previously separated us.",
18308,"Based now in Germany, the landscape looks very different, and I see exciting new opportunities in every direction.",
18309,"Finally, I look forward to strengthening networks and connections with scholars in the Middle East and in Africa.",
18310,"It is crucial that these scholars – and the communities whom they represent – are not only part of the conversation in my field, but that they stand at the center of it.",
18311,My ERC-funded BeInf project will bring two post-doctoral researchers and two senior research fellows from outside of Germany to Universität Hamburg over the next five years.,
18312,"BeInf will also host several large international conferences, which will bring dozens of scholars from Germany, from Europe, and from further abroad, including especially North America and Ethiopia.",
18313,"In addition to BeInf, I hope to inaugurate a “Semitic Studies Research Colloquium” that will hold regular lectures/seminars throughout the academic year.",
18314,These will take place in a hybrid format to foster a community at Universität Hamburg in this new research area while also broadcasting our new directions to the broader academic community.,
18315,The speakers for the “Semitic Studies Research Colloquium” will be external scholars active in the field who come to UHH to share their expertise and enthusiasm.,
18316,Because it encourages the development of new ways of thinking about old problems.,
18317,"One must only read the front page of the newspaper to know that society is faced with countless problems, for instance, the COVID pandemic, or wars, or climate change, all of which are exacerbated by our abject failure to end poverty and fight inequality.",
18318,We are a society faced with existential threats.,
18319,My research does not produce new vaccines or develop new sources of renewable energy.,
18320,It does not even teach diplomacy or geo-politics.,
18321,We undoubtedly need more research and teaching in these areas as well as many others.,
18322,"I am, however, interested in a more fundamental idea: We need a new generation of young people who can think critically, innovatively, and with self-reflection, and my research and teaching in their most basic element aim to develop this skill.",
18323,"More concretely, my research confronts questions of diversity of perspectives, competition and coexistence between groups, religious difference and tension, as well as more broadly how to study and understand historical development and change.",
18324,"I am particularly interested in the connections, contacts, circulation, integration, and exchange that characterize the human endeavour both past and present.
",
18325,"Every year, Universität Hamburg welcomes many new researchers.",
18326,"Here, we present part of a series to introduce them and their areas of research.",
18327,"Prof. Dr. Martin Eckstein, previously at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, has been working in the Department of Mathmatics and the Cluster of Excellence „CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter“ since 1 October 2022.",
18328,"I study the dynamics of so-called quantum matter, i.e., systems in which unusual macroscopic behavior is caused by quantum effects on the microscopic scale.",
18329,We try to understand theoretically how interesting behaviour like superconductivity can be influenced in a targeted manner and on the shortest possible timescales.,
18330,"The description of such interacting many-particle systems often requires new concepts, which sometimes use quantum physical concepts themselves as part of the solution.",
18331,It has always been one of the most fundamental questions in physics how extraordinary macroscopic behavior arises from the cooperative interaction of many interacting objects.,
18332,"For example, the interaction of electrons in matter gives rise to unexpected phenomena such as superconductivity, in which electric current flows without resistance.",
18333,We are particularly interested in the non-equilibrium dynamics of such states: Can we learn about the origin of cooperative behavior from the temporal evolution after an excitation?,
18334,"Are there ways to influence this behavior in a controlled manner, for example through tailored light pulses?",
18335,"We try to answer such questions theoretically, i.e., starting from the equations which describe the microscopic motion of electrons and atoms, and we collaborate with experimental groups that can gain detailed insight into the dynamics of complex matter using new devices such as the X-ray free-electron laser XFEL in Hamburg.",
18336,"For the theoretical understanding of the microscopic behaviour, the laws of quantum mechanics are of central importance: As illustrated in the example of Schrödingers cat, a quantum system can be present in several states at the same time.",
18337,"The number of these states increases exponentially when the number of particles in increased, and one quickly encounters equations that cannot be solved even with modern high performance computers.",
18338,"This multitude of possible states poses both the challenge for understanding quantum phenomena, and their potential for applications in the field of quantum technology.",
18339,"Our exciting task is to find new methods to describe these many particle systems, which ultimately also use quantum physical concepts themselves as part of the solution., With the Cluster of Excellence CUI and research institutes such as the Max Planck Institute MPSD, Hamburg has developed into a location that is worldwide at the forefront in the field of the dynamics of quantum matter.",
18340,"The experimental infrastructure, including large devices such as the X-ray laser XFEL, allows a unique insight how complex processes in matter evolve over time.",
18341,I look forward to working with colleagues in this environment.,
18342,"At the same time, I got to know Hamburg as a cosmopolitan city with a high quality of life.",
18343,"The recent developments at the university and the exciting plans for the future show that science and education are held in high esteem here, not just in physics.",
18344,"I am convinced that all this makes Hamburg highly attractive for students and scientists from Germany and abroad, which will help to further establish this place as a leading science city.",
18345,"For me, quantum physics is the most fascinating field of physics.",
18346,"It contradicts our intuition in all its central principles, but is fundamentally important for understanding the nature that surrounds us.",
18347,"Theoretical solid state physics builds directly on the principles of quantum physics, and therefore stands at the exciting interface between a classical understanding of matter and new concepts of quantum technology: on the one hand we want to understand how quantum physics underlies the properties of matter, on the other hand we use quantum physical concepts themselves as a solution to various problems.",
18348,"I am convinced that quantum physics will continue to gain in importance for technological developments in the coming years, and that an understanding of quantum mechanics will play an increasingly important role outside of physics.",
18349,"With an appropriate education in physics, I would like to help prepare students to participate in this technological revolution.",
18350,Theoretical physics is and always has been a very international field.,
18351,"Almost every day I have discussions with colleagues from abroad, recently with working groups in Slovenia (Josef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana), Switzerland (University of Fribourg), Italy (University of Trieste, University of Salerno), the USA (Flatiron Institute in New York), and Japan (University of Tokyo).
",
18352,Ruprecht I’s decree founding the university contained strictures mandating academic clothing.,
18353,The decree references the Sorbonne and was binding on all four original faculties: “Every Magister and Bacchalarius shall pursue academic activities clad in cappas and church garments comparable to and in similar proportions as are currently common at the appropriate Parisian faculties.”,
18354,"Because the earliest European universities were ecclesiastical institutions, the students’ clothing resembled that of monks.",
18355,"The cappa, a wrap like a hooded coat, originally had one slit for the arms before a second slit was added and was complimented with a biretta.",
18356,"Beginning in the 16th century, the original tunic-like garment gradually was replaced by a robe-like coat – the gown.",
18357,The gown originated in the clerical habitus of the Reformation and was always embroidered with fur for academic purposes.,
18358,Faculty-specific colours have been widespread in Germany since the 17th century.,
18359,Heidelberg used the following colour code: theology: purple; law: red; medicine: green; sciences and mathematics: yellow; philosophy: blue.,
18360,"By the end of the 17th century only professors wore gowns, a tradition that continued throughout the 19th century and up to the 1960s, when the gowns were abolished.",
18361,"In 1968, West German students revolted against the traditionalism of German universities.",
18362,"With their slogan, “Under the gowns is a stale air of a thousand of years,” they tried to create a more modern teaching and learning environment.",
18363,"In the aftermath of these protests, West Germany dispensed with such traditions as gowns and commencement celebrations.",
18364,Heidelberg University has been reintroducing gowns gradually since the mid-1990s.,
18365,"The law faculty started wearing gowns again during doctoral celebrations, and the theological and medical faculties followed suit.",
18366,"As of 2001, all members of the university leadership, as well as all of the deans of the various faculties, wear gowns for the Annual Celebration, doctoral commencement ceremonies, receptions with international guests and other academic events.
",
18367,"On 23 October 1385, Pope Urban VI approves the founding of the university in Heidelberg by Elector Palatine Rupert I. Instruction begins a year later on 18 October 1386 in three faculties: theology, jurisprudence and philosophy.",
18368,Medicine follows two years later in 1388.,
18369,The first rector is Marsilius von Inghen of the Netherlands; the first professors come from Paris and Prague.,
18370,"After assuming power in 1556, Elector Palatine Otto Henry converts the university into a reformed protestant institution and in 1558 establishes new statutes that remain largely in force until 1786.",
18371,The university enjoys a period of great prosperity.,
18372,"Esteemed as a centre of the European sciences and culture, the universitys international appeal draws professors and students from all over Europe.",
18373,", The university is hit hard by the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648).",
18374,Teaching is suspended several times.,
18375,"In 1623, the Bibliotheca Palatina, one of the most valuable collections of German manuscripts of the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Age, is carted to Rome in reparation for the war.",
18376,The university reopens in 1652.,
18377,The university’s arduous comeback after the Thirty Years’ War shatters with the complete destruction of Heidelberg by the troops of King Louis XIV in the Palatine War of Succession (1688-1697).,
18378,The university remains closed until 1703.,
18379,"Finally, in 1712, the cornerstone is laid for a new university building, todays Old University.",
18380,"For numerous reasons, not the least of which is financial mismanagement, the university experiences a period of decline through the end of the century.",
18381,", In 1803 the university is acquired by Baden and reorganised as a state-financed academy following an edict of Charles Frederick of Baden.",
18382,"In 1805 it is named Ruperto Carola – a combination of the name of the university’s founder Rupert and Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden.",
18383,"As a cosmopolitan and liberal university, Heidelberg enjoys its second golden age during the 19th century.",
18384,"Through the work of Robert Bunsen, Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann Helmholtz, the natural sciences in particular reach a zenith.",
18385,"Around the turn of the century, the Baden state government permits women to enter the university for the first time.",
18386,"In April of 1900, Georgine Sexauer from Karlsruhe is the first female student to enter her name in the Matriculation Register of Ruperto Carola.",
18387,"Finally, in the year 1923, Gertrud von Ubisch is the first woman to receive her professorship in Heidelberg.",
18388,"With the rise to power of the National Socialists, 59 of 214 Heidelberg academics are expelled and disenfranchised for “racial” or “political” reasons.",
18389,"In a move that symbolises the malevolence of the period, the sculpture of Athena and the inscription “Dem lebendigen Geist” (To the Living Spirit) are removed from above the portal of the New University in 1936.",
18390,They are replaced with an oversized eagle and the words “Dem deutschen Geist” (To the German Spirit).,
18391,"After the end of the war, instruction resumes gradually.",
18392,The first rector of the post-war period is the surgeon Karl Heinrich Bauer.,
18393,"The university now begins to spread out over three campuses: in the Old Town (humanities), in Bergheim (medicine), and, beginning in the 1960s, in Neuenheimer Feld (natural sciences, medicine).",
18394,This period is characterised by increasing student numbers and a progressive differentiation of the disciplines.,
18395,"After the student riots that marked this era, the university is given a new basic order in 1969.",
18396,The five faculties are temporarily divided into sixteen (the number is reduced to twelve in 2002).,
18397,"Heidelberg University succeeds in enhancing its outstanding reputation and the related attractiveness for international students, doctoral candidates and researchers.",
18398,"2002 sees the opening of the Heidelberg Center Latin America in Santiago de Chile, the first of now four centres abroad of Ruperto Carola in South Asia, North and Latin America, and Japan.",
18399,Heidelberg University is successful with all six proposals in the two rounds of Germany’s Excellence Initiative in 2006/2007 and 2012.,
18400,"It receives funding for its institutional strategy “Heidelberg: Realising the Potential of a Comprehensive University”, two Clusters of Excellence and three graduate schools.",
18401,From October 2010 to October 2011 the university celebrates its 625th anniversary true to its motto Zukunft.,
18402,Seit 1386 (The Future.,
18403,Since 1386).,
18404,"With its institutional strategy “The Comprehensive Research University – Heidelberg: The Future since 1386” and two Clusters of Excellence, the university holds its own in the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments and is one of the group of ten Universities of Excellence and one Excellence Alliance in Germany to receive funding from 2019.",
18405,"On 1 October 2021, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences is founded as the university’s thirteenth faculty
",
18406,"The seal shows the apostle Peter, the university’s patron saint, sitting under a canopy.",
18407,"The two kneeling knights are most likely elector Ruprecht I on the right in the wax imprint and his nephew, co-regent and successor Ruprecht II on the left.",
18408,"They are shown giving Peter parts of their wealth, symbolised by the escutcheons they are giving into his custody.",
18409,"The left shield depicts the Bavarian diamonds, the right one the Palatine lion.",
18410,"An elaborate silver seal was commissioned early in the university’s history – on November 18, 1386 – and this seal remained a part of the university’s insignia for many years.",
18411,"Towards the end of the 17th century, however, the seal was lost during the confusion of the War of Palatine Succession.",
18412,"After its “rediscovery” in an art shop decades later, the seal made its way into the possession of the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg, where it has resided since the 19th century.",
18413,"To prevent anything from happening to the silver seal, the university also commissioned a simple seal, adorned with the same picture, for everyday use.",
18414,"How many such seals it commissioned and when, however, remains unclear.",
18415,"Three of these simple metal seals have been preserved, and in 2004, the university archive was able to purchase one of these from a private owner (see picture).",
18416,The seal is 70mm in diameter.,
18417,"The circumscription begins at the top, slightly off-centre, and",
18418,reads:+s[igillum] universitatis,
18419,[ornament] studii [ornament] heydelbergensis,
18420,[ornament].,
18421,The scripture ribbon is bordered on both sides by a rope of pearls.,
18422,"Following these artistic elements, the seal now is usually used in a printed form.",
18423,"Pitted and stylised with clear lines, it is a ubiquitous element of the university’s logo – used for the anniversary medals in 1961 and 1986, book covers or signs – and forms an important part of the university’s corporate design.
",
18424,Heidelberg University – also known as Ruperto Carola – was established in 1386 and is Germany’s oldest university.,
18425,It is also one of the strongest research universities in all of Europe.,
18426,"In 1386, Ruprecht I, Elector Palatine, received the Pope’s permission to establish the university in his residential city of Heidelberg.",
18427,The Dutch scholar Marsilius of Inghen who came to Heidelberg from the Paris University became the new university’s first rector.,
18428,"In the centuries since its founding, Heidelberg University has experienced many ups and downs in connection with its scientific reputation, its intellectual charisma, and its attractiveness to professors and students.",
18429,In the 16th century Heidelberg evolved into a centre of humanism.,
18430,Martin Luther’s public defense of his Ninety-Five Theses in April 1518 had a lasting effect.,
18431,"In the years following, the university gained a special reputation as a Calvinist stronghold.",
18432,The Heidelberg Catechism was written in 1563 and to this day remains a fundamental confessional for the reformed church.,
18433,"After a difficult span of years marked by revolutions and financial mismanagement, Baden’s first grand duke Karl Friedrich reorganised the university.",
18434,"The university added his name to that of its founder, thereafter calling itself Ruprecht-Karls-Universität.",
18435,"During the 19th century, Heidelberg was widely celebrated not only for its high level of research but also for its liberality, commitment to democratic ideals, and openness to new ideas.",
18436,"Resulting from this, the high reputation of the university attracted a large number of foreign students.",
18437,"This second flowering was marked by extraordinary research efforts across all faculties and was punctuated by such researchers as Robert Bunsen, Hermann Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Max Weber.",
18438,"As with its first flowering, Heidelberg saw its second great prospering end with the outbreak of war in 1914.",
18439,The two world wars in the first half of the 20th century and the circumstances associated with the National Socialist dictatorship plunged Heidelberg University into a nadir from which it only recovered with great difficulty.,
18440,"From the mid-1960s, Heidelberg University became a mass university, like many others.",
18441,"Between 1950 and 1960 the student numbers doubled, then tripled again between 1961 and 2010, leading to extreme overcrowding.",
18442,"Despite financial bottlenecks in this period, Heidelberg University was able to regain and expand its outstanding reputation and its related attractiveness for international students and researchers.",
18443,The successes of Heidelberg University in the Excellence Competitions and in international rankings are evidence of its leading role on the academic scene.,
18444,In the Excellence Initiative of 2006/07 and 2012 the university was successful with all its proposals and received funding for its institutional strategy “Heidelberg: Realising the Potential of a Comprehensive University” as well as for the two Clusters of Excellence “Cellular Networks” and “Asia and Europe in a Global Context”.,
18445,"Three graduate schools were also funded – the Heidelberg Graduate School for Physics, the Heidelberg Biosciences International Graduate School and the Heidelberg Graduate School of Mathematical and Computational Methods for the Sciences.",
18446,"In the framework of the Excellence Strategy, the university has been funded since 2019 as a University of Excellence with its institutional strategy “The Comprehensive Research University – Heidelberg: The Future since 1386” and the two Clusters of Excellence “STRUCTURES” and “3D Matter Made to Order”.",
18447,"Within the Excellence Strategy, the university is further expanding the link between its Fields of Focus with two new Flagship Initiatives and, furthermore, laying special emphasis on promoting the transfer of research findings into society.
",
18448,"Since Heidelberg University was founded in 1386, 748 rectors have directed the fortunes of Ruperto Carola.",
18449,Both the tasks and decision-making powers as well as the criteria according to which they were elected changed time and again over the course of time.,
18450,"In 1386, Magister Marsilius von Inghen was elected as the first rector for a term of three months, with the option of unrestricted re-election.",
18451,He was nine times rector of the university.,
18452,"Until the middle of the 19th century very short terms of office were usual at Heidelberg University, so that a large part of the ordinaries were elected as Rector at least once, some even several times.",
18453,"In the face of increasing demands, many universities at that time tended to assign the office of rector only to professors with special qualifications.",
18454,"In 1862, the law professor Carl Adolph von Vangerow was elected as the first Rector of Ruperto Carola.",
18455,"Only 30 years later, this mode was abandoned again in favour of the faculty rotation.",
18456,"After 1945, the free election of the rector became permanent.",
18457,The extension of the rectors term of office after 1970 had a noticeable impact on the career paths of the rectors.,
18458,Only one of the twelve rectors elected after 1969 accepted a call to another university after his term of office – Adolf Laufs.,
18459,"Of the 25 rectors elected between 1945 and 1969, six, on the other hand, accepted a post at another university or institution at the end of their term of office.",
18460,"In 1966, Margot Becke, the first and so far only woman to be elected Rector of Heidelberg University, was elected., Since 2000, the rectors term of office has been six years, as laid down in the Baden-Württemberg Universities Act.",
18461,"In addition, a person who is not a full-time Heidelberg professor can also be elected as Rector., The incumbent rector of Ruperto Carola is geographer Bernhard Eitel.
",
18462,"“Senior Professor” is an honorary degree, inaugurated in 2007, that can be bestowed upon a university professor following his or her retirement or the conclusion of their obligations.",
18463,The rectorate decides who shall receive the title.,
18464,Heidelberg University awards both “Senior Professor” and “Senior Professor Distinctus” titles.,
18465,"Upon faculty request, the rectorate may give the temporary title of “Senior Professor” to a retired professor still working at the university.",
18466,A Senior Professor can sign a service contract for a limited time specifying their rights and duties during their continued work at Heidelberg University.,
18467,The amount and duration of duties assigned to a Senior Professor may differ from case to case.,
18468,The rectorate may bestow the title “Senior Professor Distinctus” on distinguished professors after their retirement or the conclusion of their obligations who had rendered exceptional services to the university.,
18469,"This is an honorary title awarded for life in cases of special merit and is unconnected to and does not demand any additional activities or duties at Heidelberg University.
",
18470,The Old University building was built between 1712 and 1728 on behalf of elector Johann Wilhelm and was called “Domus Wilhelmiana” in his honour.,
18471,"The Old University houses the Rector’s Office as well as the university museum, which was established in 1996.",
18472,The historic student prison (Studentenkarzer) is located in the back of the Old University.,
18473,"The Great Hall, Heidelberg University’s magnificent historic auditorium, is located on the first floor.",
18474,"Like the rest of the building, the Great Hall was long a home for courses and lectures.",
18475,Its present design dates back to Josef Durm’s redesign of the auditorium to mark the university’s 500th anniversary in 1886.,
18476,"This redesign features paintings and busts honouring the university’s founders, innovators and benefactors as well as its most important academics from its founding to the 19th century.",
18477,"Today, the Great Hall is chiefly used for academic ceremonies, though it does also lend its venerable ambience to concerts, lectures and similar celebrations, which attain a special lustre thereby.",
18478,The student prison was established in the 1780s and remained in use until 1914.,
18479,Today it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Heidelberg.,
18480,From 1823 to 1914 students were incarcerated for offenses such as disturbance of the peace by night and other breaches of the public order.,
18481,The university has had the privilege of disciplining its own members since its founding.,
18482,"Since 1886, however, its jurisdiction has extended only to disciplinary procedures.",
18483,"Students could be incarcerated for durations from two days to four weeks, depending on their offence.",
18484,"Although students were theoretically permitted to continue attending lectures during their terms, life in detention was considered quite comfortable and the arrest was frequently used to skip lectures and spend time immortalising oneself on the walls and ceiling with drawings and poems.",
18485,Today the university is trying to preserve these legacies in order to share these unique historical testimonials to student prison life with future generations.,
18486,"The university museum, on the ground level of the Old University, offers an exciting tour through the history of Germany’s oldest university.",
18487,"Exhibits, portraits and documents are testimonies for the zeitgeist of the individual epochs, beginning with the founding in 1386 by elector Ruprecht I and running up to the end of the 20th century.",
18488,"The university’s history is depicted in three separate epochs – the epoch of the Palatine electors, the Baden era and the twentieth century.",
18489,Alongside the rooms housing permanent exhibits is the space dedicated to hosting temporary exhibitions.,
18490,A different special exhibit opens in this space roughly every three to four months.,
18491,An advanced seminar on sigillography held at the Department of History in the winter semester of 2008/09 unearthed new information about the Great Seal of Heidelberg University; the following is a brief overview of the findings.,
18492,The Great University Seal was commissioned directly after the inauguration of the University in 1386.,
18493,It was used to authenticate important University documents until the 18th century.,
18494,The original silver seal is now on display at the National Museum (Germanisches Nationalmuseum) in Nuremberg.,
18495,"Heidelberg University still owns three bronze seals (a broken seal in the Rectorate and two seals in the University Archives, one of which was purchased from an antiques dealer a few years ago); there is, however, considerable doubt as to their authenticity.",
18496,"For the past 40 years, the University has been using a paper embossing seal that is fashioned after the mediaeval original.",
18497,"This seal is still the distinctive symbol of the University; it is used on letterheads, the Universitys websites and numerous other publications., A comparison between this new old seal and the original wax impressions shows a number of differences that are probably due to faulty examinations of the mediaeval seal: The two kneeling figures holding the escutcheons are both bearded; there is no apparent age difference, which would support the widespread but unfounded assumption [1] that these figures represent Ruprecht I and his nephew Ruprecht II.",
18498,The kneeling figures are not armour-clad.,
18499,This fault is likely due to a medal showing the same image that was created in 1686 to commemorate the Universitys 300th anniversary.,

18567,Shedding more light on the innovative work of women and their achievements in the scholarly context is the focus of a research project led by Prof. Dr Christiane Schwieren.,
18568,"A researcher at the Alfred Weber Institute for Economics and Equal Opportunities Commissioner of Heidelberg University, she wants to explore the functional mechanisms of “visibility”, identify inhibiting and conducive factors, and suggest structural changes.",
18569,"The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the research studies for three years to the tune of approximately 540,000 euros.",
18570,"The project, which has now started, is being executed in cooperation with the equal opportunities office and hei_INNOVATION, the transfer agency of Ruperto Carola.",
18571,"“Innovative scholarly work by women inside and outside the university context is still less visible than that of their male colleagues,” says Prof. Schwieren.",
18572,"With respect to the factors and functional mechanisms of “visibility”, her project “heiCHANGE – Visibility Through Structural Change” aims to study the kind of academic contributions that are not reflected in standard indicators such as publications of research findings.",
18573,"These contributions include, for instance, enthusiastic teaching, participating in committees or transferring knowledge into society.",
18574,"If a spotlight is shone on all facets of university work, women’s “visibility” rises; that is one hypothesis to be tested in the framework of the project.",
18575,The research led by Prof. Schwieren in the field of organisational behaviour is accompanied by programmes and projects implemented by the transfer agency hei_INNOVATION.,
18576,"Heidelberg University’s central facility UNIFY – Unit for Family, Diversity and Equality plays a bridging role in this connection.",
18577,The heiCHANGE project is divided into three main sections.,
18578,In the field of behavioural economics Prof. Schwieren and her team want to study the extent to which gender-specific preferences play a role when it comes to choosing activities that are of relative benefit to a person’s individual career but fundamental to the success of scholarly and scientific endeavour as such.,
18579,"Parallel to that, elements of individual knowledge and experience are to be analysed in a “real-life laboratory” in order to generate innovative ideas for structural changes.",
18580,The third heiCHANGE section is the transfer of research findings into society in order to devise and communicate a new image of research as a professional field.,
18581,"That includes a series of events for information and discussion developed by hei_INNOVATION with experts who, based on their individual experience, are able to communicate scientific knowledge and innovative working methods into society.",
18582,"“The special feature of our project is that it allows for linking up basic research with hands-on options for action as part of my activity as Equal Opportunities Commissioner of Heidelberg University,” says Christiane Schwieren.",
18583,"“Our research studies in connection with proposals for structural measures are intended to make another important contribution towards the innovative, modern, evidence-based career promotion that the university pursues in all academic fields.”",
18584,"In the context of heiCHANGE, the university is a cooperation partner in the networking initiative of the ZEIT publishing house to foster women in academia.",
18585,This offers young researchers from all disciplines the opportunity to become part of the network “Zia – Visible Women in Science” and to avail themselves of various career-enhancing opportunities during a one-year fellowship programme.,
18586,"The cooperation, extending over two years, also enables selected fellows to participate in the research project and share in designing the different formats of the ZEIT initiative, such as workshops or podcasts.",
18587,"The heiCHANGE project led by Prof. Schwieren is part of the funding priority “Innovative Women in Focus”, with which the BMBF seeks to raise women’s chances of participating in science, research and innovation and actually achieving equal opportunities.",

18665,"Using the observations of a distant, very luminous galaxy, an international research team has discovered a cluster of galaxies with the aid of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and, at the same time, one of the densest known areas of galaxy formation in the early Universe.",
18666,The observations from the new space telescope revealed a galaxy protocluster forming in the region around a quasar.,
18667,This emerging galaxy cluster could give information about how galaxies in the early Universe evolved into the cosmic network visible today.,
18668,"Dr Dominika Wylezalek, a scientist at the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University (ZAH), was in charge of the research work.",
18669,"The focus of the investigations was a galaxy with a very active, luminous core, which is fed by a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy.",
18670,"It is assumed that such a core, known as a quasar, can launch a “galactic wind” that pushes the gas out of the host galaxy.",
18671,These outflows of matter could thereby influence the formation of other stars and galaxies.,
18672,The international research team led by Dr Wylezalek observed the quasar SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 – J1652 for short – with the James Webb Space Telescope.,
18673,"The quasar existed back in the very early Universe, that is, about 11.5 billion years ago.",
18674,Its striking red light was shifted into the infra-red due to its large distance and the expansion of the Universe.,
18675,"Hence quasar J1652 is particularly suited to observations with the James Webb telescope, which was designed especially for observations in this spectral range.",
18676,Previous investigations showed that fast gas outflows are driven by the quasar and found evidence for the merging of the quasar with a neighbouring galaxy.,
18677,"Surprisingly, the observations with the JWST confirm that not only one galaxy but at least three more are swirling around at high speed and are tightly packed.",
18678,Scientists also call such a system a galaxy protocluster – a cluster of galaxies in formation.,
18679,The objects in the direct environment of the quasar were analysed with infrared spectroscopy.,
18680,"According to Dr Wylezalek, they indicate that J1652 is part of a dense knot of galaxy formation.",
18681,This conclusion is only possible due to the outstanding imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope.,
18682,“There are few galaxy protoclusters known at this early time.,
18683,They are hard to find and very few have had time to form since the Big Bang.,
18684,"Our discovery may help us understand how galaxies in dense environments evolve,” says the astrophysicist.",
18685,“We are looking into the earliest phases of the evolution of these galaxies.”,
18686,The international researcher team suggests that they have discovered one of the densest known areas of galaxy formation in the early Universe – taking account of the speed at which the three confirmed galaxies are orbiting each other and how closely they are packed into the region around the quasar.,
18687,“Even a dense knot of dark matter is not sufficient to explain the properties wehave observed.,
18688,"We think we could be seeing a region in which two knots of dark matter are merging together,” says the scientist, who heads an Emmy Noether junior research group at Heidelberg University’s Institute for Astronomical Computing, which belongs to the ZAH.",
18689,"From follow-up observations she hopes to understand how dense, chaotic galaxy clusters like this one form and how they evolved to become the cosmic network visible today.",
18690,"With her team, to which postdoctoral researcher Dr Caroline Bertemes also belongs, Dr Wylezalek first wants to discover how the protocluster is affected by galactic winds and quasar feedback generated by the active, supermassive black hole at its heart.",
18691,"Besides the Heidelberg team, other scientists from Germany, France, the UK, Mexico and the United States were involved in the research.",
18692,The observations with the James Webb Space Telescope took place as part of the Early Release Science Programme within the first five months after the start of JWST scientific operations.,
18693,"The German Research Foundation, the Daimler and Benz Foundation and the German Aerospace Center supported the research carried out at Heidelberg University.

18750,Star dunes are among the largest dune formations on Earth and – due to their changing shape over time – they can be important indicators for understanding the effects of climate change.,
18751,Scientists from Heidelberg University’s Institute of Geography have examined such a dune in the Erg Chebbi sandy desert in Morocco by means of state-of-the-art laser scanning.,
18752,"For the first time, they linked highly accurate 3D measurements of changes in the dune surface with a continuous collection of wind data.",
18753,"Surveying the surface dynamics of the star dune was made possible through cooperation between two research groups, one on geomorphology around Prof.",
18754,Dr Olaf Bubenzer and the other on geoinformatics around Prof. Dr Bernhard Höfle.,
18755,"The large star dune formations can be found worldwide in almost all sand seas, which are called ergs.",
18756,"The morphology of these dunes is highly complex, being the result of past and present wind dynamics and their sand movements.",
18757,Their basic structure is often several thousand – even up to ten thousand – years old.,
18758,"Hence, they also reflect the respective climate conditions and related factors over time, such as vegetation cover.",
18759,"The change in vegetation cover and the transportation of sediments can enable a deeper understanding of the growth and decline of sandy deserts, and therefore also provide insights into the impacts of climate change in arid regions.",
18760,"However, there has not yet been sufficient explanation of how star dunes evolve and change.",
18761,New detailed and repeated measurements of wind and surface dynamics now enable a better understanding of the way these complex dune formations develop.,
18762,The sandy surface in the Erg Chebbi desert in Morocco was surveyed by means of terrestrial laser scanning.,
18763,That produces a 3D model of a landscape using hundreds of millions of measuring points.,
18764,From the repeated measurement data the Heidelberg scientists were able to derive changes taking place in the dune shape between October 2018 and February 2020.,
18765,"In addition, the changes in the course of the complex dune crests were captured as horizontal movement.",
18766,They represent the sand transport and can be related to the hourly measurements of the direction and speed of wind.,
18767,"The sand on the dunes is only transported at wind speeds exceeding about six metres per second, which the researchers say corresponds roughly to the speed of the fastest 5,000-metre runner.",
18768,"“To our surprise, we noticed a shielding effect when analysing the star dune in Morocco.",
18769,"At places where a loss of sand is usually to be expected the dune we were investigating had an accumulation of sand,” said Manuel Herzog, a doctoral student in Prof. Bubenzer’s research group.",
18770,"Such sand accumulation leads to growth at the dune arms, which seems to lead to large dunes like the one studied in the Erg Chebbi sustaining themselves.",
18771,"This suggests that, besides their height, the steep slope angles at the dune arms have greater significance for sand transport than assumed to date.",
18772,“An important factor in observing the dynamics of star dunes is to survey these dunes more frequently using 3D laser scanning.,
18773,"That is the only way we can improve our estimates of how the sand transport takes place on different time scales, for instance considering seasonal effects,” says Olaf Bubenzer.",
18774,"The Heidelberg scientists from geomorphology and geoinformatics want to transfer their analytical approach – linking 3D measurements of surface changes with continuous capture of wind data – to other geographical areas, in order to better understand these complex mega-dune formations and the underlying wind-related dynamics.",
18775,"That way, and going beyond certain sand dune formations, they hope to come up with new findings on climate change issues concerning, in particular, assumptions about the spread of arid regions.

18956,The Codex Manesse – a splendidly crafted collection of Middle High German songs and sayings in the stocks of the Heidelberg University Library – has been admitted to UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme as world documentary heritage.,
18957,"The German Commission for UNESCO announced that on Thursday, 18 May 2023.",
18958,The Codex – also known as the “Great Heidelberg Book of Songs” – is regarded as one of the world’s most famous books and can be accessed digitally worldwide.,
18959,"Alongside the elaborately crafted illustrations of medieval courtly life, a considerable part of what has remained preserved from German Minnesang is exclusively found in this large-format parchment manuscript.",
18960,"“That is what makes the Codex Manesse unique and of extraordinary universal value,” says library director Dr Veit Probst.",
18961,"Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Heidelberg University, states: “The Heidelberg University Library has rich and highly renowned historical collections, with the Codex Manesse as its most precious item.",
18962,"Admission to world documentary heritage pays tribute to the significance of this unique testimony from the past”, adding that the digitisation of the “Great Heidelberg Book of Songs” enables any interested person to browse, page by page, through the centuries-old manuscript with its delicate drawings.",
18963,"The main part of the Codex Manesse emerged around the year 1300 in Zurich – presumably at the behest of Rüdiger Manesse and his son Johannes, who wanted to collect Middle High German songs in all their variety of genre and form.",
18964,Several more contributions were made to it until about 1340.,
18965,The manuscript comprises 426 parchment sheets inscribed on both sides.,
18966,They contain the texts of 140 poets in a total of approx.,
18967,"6,000 verses.",
18968,Over half the works are only extant here.,
18969,Dr Probst: “Some of the authors in the Codex Manesse are only known from this volume.,
18970,"Without this manuscript, they and their work would be lost today.”",
18971,The opulent format of the Codex Manesse is of outstanding artistic quality.,
18972,"137 coloured, full-page miniatures are placed before the texts; they show idealised portrayals of the poets engaged in courtly activities.",
18973,"“The illustrations had a worldwide influence on the image of the European Middle Ages and document the visual representation of this period,” emphasises Prof. Dr Bernd Schneidmüller, an expert for medieval history at Heidelberg University.",
18974,The oldest texts date back to the mid-12th century.,
18975,"According to the historian, this makes the manuscript one of the key products of the literature and culture of the Hohenstaufen period.",
18976,The exact circumstances surrounding the origin of the Codex Manesse are unknown.,
18977,It is documented that the manuscript was in the possession of the Heidelberg Electors from the early 17th century.,
18978,"Before the city of Heidelberg was conquered by Catholic League troops in 1622 it was presumably taken along by the princely family as they fled and, after the death of Elector Friedrich V in 1632, sold by his widow Elisabeth Stuart to meet her financial needs.",
18979,"From 1657 the manuscript was located in the Royal Library in Paris, the present-day Bibliothèque nationale de France.",
18980,In 1888 it returned to Heidelberg in a complicated Franco-English-German exchange.,
18981,Since then it has been in the Heidelberg University Library.,
18982,"For many years now, the Codex has been kept in an air-conditioned safe in the University Library and, for conservation reasons, it is only shown publicly on very rare occasions.",
18983,"Besides the digitised version accessible online, visitors can view an elaborately fashioned facsimile in the University Library.",
18984,The Memory of the World Programme was launched in 1992 with the goal of safeguarding documents of universal value and making them accessible to the public.,
18985,"The admission of the Codex Manesse was decided in Paris by the UNESCO Executive Board, the policy-making body of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, on 18 May 2023.",

19002,"The Ruperto Carola poster calendar for 2023, which has just appeared, gives a rare glimpse over the roofs of the Heidelberg University Library.",
19003,The large A2 format poster features a picture taken during the extensive restoration of the historical building in Heidelberg’s Old City.,
19004,The current construction phase involves refurbishing work on the striking facade of the castle-like south wing and the roof structure.,
19005,"Since the building is concealed by scaffolding up to the roofs, craftspeople and the photographer are able to view elements that are otherwise not visible.",
19006,These include high-quality rooftop artworks made of stone and iron.,
19007,"The restoration is taking place in close coordination with the heritage authorities, giving priority to preservation.",
19008,Art restoration specialists replicate and replace elements that are too damaged to preserve.,
19009,"Moreover, the roof is being retiled, as before, in dark slate.",
19010,"The work on the south wing constitutes an important intermediate step in the multi-stage building project that began in 2009 and, in addition, comprises comprehensive rebuilding and extensions.",
19011,Heidelberg Castle can be seen in the background.,
19012,"Members of the university and interested individuals can pick up the new calendar from the internal post rooms in the university administration (Seminarstraße 2) and Im Neuenheimer Feld 367, room 021.

19013,"In the current approval round of the German Research Foundation (DFG), Heidelberg University has been successful with four applications to fund large research consortia, receiving funding worth a total of approximately 63 million euros.",
19014,Two Collaborative Research Centres on the topic of chronic pain and malignant brain tumours will continue for four more years each at the Medical Faculty Heidelberg.,
19015,"Likewise extended is a CRC/Transregio on dermatological and immunological questions, in which Heidelberg medics cooperate with partners in Tübingen and Mainz.",
19016,"In addition, scientists from the Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH), who are also members of Ruperto Carola, are playing a major role in a transregional consortium in Berlin, Dresden and Mannheim on how to deal with addictive drugs.",
19017,The office of spokesperson will change to CIMH in Mannheim.,
19018,"It is the second funding phase for Collaborative Research Centre “Understanding and targeting resistance in glioblastoma” (CRC 1389), with its studies aimed at combating resistance to the treatment of these malignant brain tumours.",
19019,"Existing treatment strategies lead sooner or later to resistance to therapy where the fundamental molecular mechanisms have been only partially understood, if at all, for most of the procedures generally regarded as standard.",
19020,The scientists want to achieve “treatability” by a comprehensive approach.,
19021,"To this effect, they intend to push ahead with the clinical implementation of the research findings, examining more intensively not only the initial illness",
19022,but also the progression phase.,
19023,"The CRC approach centres on the “Core Collection”, which brings together uniform, integrated datasets from high through-put procedures for molecular analyses, preclinical models, imaging and clinical data.",
19024,"Spokesperson for CRC 1389, with its funding of around 14.9 million euros, is Prof. Dr Wolfgang Wick, Executive Director of the Neurology Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital and Head of the Clinical Cooperation Unit Neurooncology at the German Cancer Research Center.",
19025,In Collaborative Research Centre “From nociception to chronic pain: structure-function properties of neural pathways and their reorganization” (CRC 1158),
19026,the scientists involved examine how acute pain turns into chronic pain.,
19027,They focus on changes in nerve cells and nerve pathways.,
19028,"To that effect, they have already been able to elucidate important molecular and cellular mechanisms.",
19029,"In the third and last funding period, researchers will particularly explore how this chronicity can be prevented or reversed.",
19030,"The aim is for chronic pain to be treated and prevented not only by administering new medication but, inter alia, also by neuromodulatory and cognitive intervention.",
19031,"The CRC Spokesperson is still Prof. Dr Rohini Kuner, Director of the Institute of Pharmacology at the Medical Faculty Heidelberg of Heidelberg University.",
19032,The DFG has allocated around 17.5 million euros to fund the Collaborative Research Centre.,
19033,Collaborative Research Centre/Transregio “The skin as sensor and effector organ orchestrating local and systemic immune responses” (CRC/TRR 156) explores the question of what role the skin plays in warding off pathogens.,
19034,A central element here is regulating systemic immune responses since immune cells in the skin not only trigger a local response to certain stimuli but can also cause the whole immune system to respond.,
19035,"In this context, the researchers in CRC/TRR 156 study how immune cells in the skin interact with one another and also with other skin cell types.",
19036,They want to gain new insights into how different cell types in the skin influence other immune cells and hence the body’s multi-layered resistance to disease.,
19037,"The third funding period will concentrate on the clinical application of research findings, for example by conducting studies on human auto immune diseases.",
19038,"The Spokesperson of CRC/TRR 156 remains Prof. Dr Alexander Enk, Executive Director of the University Dermatology Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.",

19052,2.6 million euros; approx.,
19053,"650,000 euros have been approved for the first three-year funding phase.",
19054,"“The Handbook of Constitutional Law has always been the reference work of German constitutional law,” Prof. Kube underlines.",
19055,"As part of the academic field of public law, constitutional law deals with the structure of the state and its organs, their mutual relations and their functions – state organisational law.",
19056,"In addition, it devotes itself to basic rights, i.e. the citizens’ freedom and equality rights towards the state.",
19057,"The first volume of the new handbook explains “Foundations, Transformation and Challenges” of constitutional law; how it arose and continues to develop, as well as its basic principles, is the topic of volume two.",
19058,The third volume will cover the complex of topics connected with democracy.,
19059,Prof. Kischel underlines that the newly designed handbook with its planned twelve volumes intends to reflect the whole of German-speaking constitutional law.,
19060,“It seeks to take up all currents and give reliable information while shaping the future.”,
19061,"At the same time, it aims to show how German constitutional law is tied into European and international contexts.",
19062,"The two editors also want to create interdisciplinary connections to adjacent subjects like philosophy, history, political science and economics.",
19063,Roughly 200 scholars from Germany and abroad will be involved in the handbook project as authors.,
19064,The project funded by the German Research Foundation is in the tradition of previous projects.,

19078,"Besides sports, films and concerts, various excursions are planned − city tours to Nuremberg, Mainz and Frankfurt, a boat ride on the Neckar, hikes or a visit to the Schwetzingen Castle park.",
19079,Heidelberg students accompany the visitors and assist with practical questions about daily life and leisure-time activities.,
19080,"A public lecture is also on the programme, open to Heidelberg residents as well as holiday course participants.",
19081,"On 25 August Prof. Dr Gertrud M. Rösch from the Institute of German as Foreign Language Philology will speak − under the heading “Ein Zauberkreis, der magisch mich umgibt” (spell-bound in a magic circle)",
19082,− on “Heidelberg in literature from the Baroque period to the present”.,
19083,"The presentation is scheduled for 5.15pm in the New University, lecture hall 13.",
19084,Three concerts are likewise open to the public: Linda Heiberga (cello) and Medeea Teodora Iftimie (piano) will start off the musical series on 11 August with a concert for piano and cello.,
19085,"On 18 August, the “Blu” ensemble will take the audience on a musical world trip through almost all continents on earth.",
19086,"The concert series will conclude on 25 August with the programme “Musical Postcards – a concert for flute and guitar”, performed by Barbara Rosnitschek (flute) and guitarist Peter Ernst.",
19087,"All three concerts will take place in the Great Hall of the Old University, beginning at 8pm.",
19088,"The participants at the International Summer School of German Language and Culture include many scholarship holders from partner universities in the United Kingdom, India, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, and the USA.",

",
19092,"There is no patent recipe for good science communication, says Prof. Dr Ionica Smeets.",
19093,She has a professorship at Leiden University (Netherlands) where she heads the research group on Science Communication and Society.,
19094,Good science communication starts with the willingness to take responsibility – for your own research and for the impact it has in society.,
19095,"In the interview, Prof. Smeets explains why that is so important.",
19096,"You have a doctorate in mathematics, worked as a science journalist for a long time and are now doing research in the field of science communication.",
19097,How did that come about?,
19098,Smeets: That happened more or less by accident.,
19099,I have always enjoyed writing but was also good at maths.,
19100,I didn’t want to waste this talent.,
19101,While studying for my PhD it struck me that people with an interest in mathematical questions had hardly any opportunities of finding out about them in a generally comprehensible way.,
19102,Together with a fellow student I had the idea of a maths blog.,
19103,This blog became very popular and inquiries came in from TV and national newspapers.,
19104,At that point in time I had already taken courses in science journalism and it became clear to me that I preferred to work till late in the evening on a newspaper article on a mathematical topic than to get down to my dissertation.,
19105,"If you want to understand how science communication functions, you should also study it.",
19106,Now I lead my own research group and am responsible for a master’s course on this topic.,
19107,You are researching how science communication can contribute to bridging the gap between science and society.,
19108,What constitutes good science communication?,
19109,"Smeets: It’s about setting up dialogues, getting into conversation with people and swapping ideas.",
19110,"Today, knowledge comes from different sources and science is only one of them.",
19111,We have to take that seriously.,
19112,I don’t think it’s a good idea to only quote facts because science has a very emotional dimension.,
19113,Good science communication starts with asking myself what I want to achieve.,
19114,Do I want to give information about a topic?,
19115,"Or do I want to influence an attitude or opinion on a specific subject, or perhaps even change that attitude?",
19116,Those are two very different things.,
19117,Sometimes what you really want is to get people excited about a topic.,
19118,"When, for example, I visit a primary school and tell the children something about maths I don’t want to get them to learn a new way of doing arithmetic.",
19119,They are supposed to go home with the idea that science can also be exciting for them – in particular if they are children from families with little experience of education.,
19120,In my view that is a very rewarding aim.,
19121,The really complicated question – and that is a difficult discussion inside academia – is where you draw the line towards activism.,
19122,What does it mean to take on social responsibility?,
19123,"For example, should we try to convince people to stop smoking?",
19124,An oncologist would certainly agree.,
19125,But does that also mean that a climatologist should advocate actively for a change of policy or should try to change people’s behaviour?,
19126,In my opinion these are the tricky decisions.,
19127,Good science communication starts with asking myself what I want to achieve.,
19128,Do I want to give information about a topic?,
19129,"Or do I want to influence an attitude or opinion on a specific subject, or perhaps even change that attitude?",
19130,Those are two very different things.,
19131,Ionica Smeets Why should a scientist invest time at all in exchanging with the public?,
19132,"Smeets: A democracy only functions when the people living in it are in a position to take good, informed decisions.",
19133,Science has a special responsibility here.,
19134,"That is reflected in legislation, as well.",
19135,"Making scientific findings accessible to the general public is, besides research and teaching, a basic task of universities.",
19136,"That doesn’t mean that, as a mathematician, I have to make every tiny detail of my work understandable to the public at large.",
19137,"But the question of why we should be concerned with the basics of mathematics is one that, as a scientist, I must be able to answer.",
19138,It is about mathematical concepts for daily life – fundamental arithmetical and statistical findings that enable us to take decisions relevant to our lives.,
19139,We should take responsibility for this within our own area of research.,
19140,That applies to the natural sciences just as much as to the humanities and social sciences.,
19141,"Are there topics that can’t be communicated at all, or not well enough?",
19142,"Smeets: For a long time, I thought that mathematics was a field like that because it is abstract and presupposes a certain amount of prior knowledge.",
19143,"In the meantime, I think that maths is one of the topics that are easy to communicate, because there is hardly any resistance.",
19144,No one has the idea of questioning prime numbers.,
19145,It is quite different with vast interdisciplinary issues such as climate change or vaccinations.,
19146,"These are topics about which, in my view, good science communication is incredibly difficult.",
19147,That has a lot to do with trust in science.,
19148,What is the situation in that respect?,
19149,And how do you reach people who doubt scientific findings?,
19150,Smeets: There is still a lot of trust in science.,
19151,The group that mistrusts science has even diminished during the Covid pandemic.,
19152,It is still very vocal but not very big.,
19153,"Admittedly, according to surveys, people in Germany and the Netherlands think that scientists don’t spend enough time explaining their research.",
19154,Yet they still trust us and that is good news.,
19155,"However, we should proceed strategically.",
19156,The people who are very critical towards science will not be convinced by facts.,
19157,Those people mostly distrust not only science but also institutions in general.,
19158,"But there is a very large group in between, which may simply lack sufficient knowledge about a certain topic.",
19159,During the Covid pandemic people with less developed reading skills in the Netherlands were asked why they did not get vaccinated.,
19160,It turned out that they were not opposed to vaccination at all.,
19161,Most of them had different motives.,
19162,Some simply didn’t know how to arrange an appointment.,
19163,Others thought they had to pay for the vaccination and they could not afford it.,
19164,We have to reach out to such groups and for that we need really good communication formats.,
19165,"A democracy only functions when the people living in it are in a position to take good, informed decisions.",
19166,Science has a special responsibility here.,
19167,Ionica Smeets A very direct way of getting into dialogue with the public is through social media.,
19168,What do you think about them?,
19169,"Smeets: First of all, it makes a great difference whether you communicate as an individual or as an institution.",
19170,"Last year, scientists in the Netherlands, but also in Germany and elsewhere, were pretty much in the line of fire.",
19171,"Some of them are still present in the social media, and that is marvellous.",
19172,It would be terrible if all voices of reason disappeared from public discourse and left it to people with no expertise.,
19173,If I want to communicate via the social media I first have to identify the medium that suits me best.,
19174,"Personally, I prefer Twitter and really enjoy dialogue and discussion on this platform with my over 80,000 followers.",
19175,"On the other hand, I can’t get on with Instagram at all.",
19176,I’m not a visual person.,
19177,"When you have found the appropriate medium, and have properly thought through how you want to use it, the result can be very effective.",
19178,Can science communication also misfire?,
19179,What challenges do you see?,
19180,Smeets: There are considerable challenges.,
19181,It starts with how I communicate uncertainties in research.,
19182,People like certainty and prefer clear answers.,
19183,It has always been like that.,
19184,So how do you simplify a complex scientific issue without distorting it?,
19185,Another topic is personal attacks.,
19186,That sort of thing is hard to control.,
19187,"Of course, you can try not to be dragged into public debates but often just that happens, whether you like it or not.",
19188,That can also happen to institutions.,
19189,So you have to be prepared and know how to deal with such situations.,
19190,"A famous, very political example is the case of the biologist [Arthur Galston] who inadvertently contributed to developing Agent Orange.",
19191,In the course of his research he experimented with a substance that makes soy plants grow faster and bloom earlier.,
19192,One of his observations was that plants drop their leaves when too much of the substance is applied.,
19193,This was later used for the defoliant Agent Orange.,
19194,He [Galston] was very dismayed that his research findings had been used for this purpose.,
19195,"He protested, got politically involved and gave lectures.",
19196,He took the view that as a scientist it is not possible to distance yourself from the social impacts of your own research.,
19197,"And, in my opinion, that is just as true today as it was then.",
19198,"Science often claims to be a guarantor of progress, to make the world a better place.",
19199,"In return, it has to take responsibility for what happens – also for things with negative consequences.",
19200,Is science communication only something for natural scientists?,
19201,What has your experience been in Heidelberg?,
19202,Smeets: A lot of science communication does come from the natural sciences.,
19203,That is also true at the international level.,
19204,It is a pity that there are communication competitions in which only doctoral candidates from the natural or medical sciences are allowed to participate.,
19205,"It is very important to communicate well in other subjects, too, like history or psychology.",
19206,"The participants in the workshops here in Heidelberg came from very different fields of research, something I am familiar with from the Netherlands.",
19207,There were also significant differences in terms of their prior knowledge.,
19208,Some had already tried out things that others wanted to start learning about.,
19209,I was surprised that quite a lot of physicists were among the participants.,
19210,In the Netherlands it is quite difficult to get physicists to do communication training.,
19211,Did you also notice differences?,
19212,Smeets: In Germany it seems to be less usual for individual scientists to try to make contact with the public.,
19213,"In the Netherlands there are no institutions like Wissenschaft im Dialog, the National Institute for Science Communication or the Science Media Center.",
19214,Here I have noticed something like the Carl Sagan Effect.,
19215,Carl Sagan was denied access to scientific societies because he wrote popular science books and presented TV series.,
19216,"However, if you look at his publications, citations and all the traditional indicators used to measure academic excellence, he did better than those who were accepted.",
19217,"The Carl Sagan Effect describes the phenomenon that scientists or scholars who stand out through their dialogue with the public, or who appear on television, are not taken so seriously by their colleagues.",
19218,"Yet the literature shows that this is nonsense and that academically they are just as good, or even better.",
19219,The last ten years have seen a change taking place in the Netherlands.,
19220,"There has been a rise in the willingness to recognise and reward talent in this field, and to enter into discussions.",
19221,Now there is also considerably more diversity in terms of career paths.,
19222,"Here in Heidelberg I have talked to more young researchers who were advised not to invest too much time in communication activities, or to mention their experience in this field when they apply for jobs.",
19223,"Things are changing here too, but that still happens.",
19224,Should science communication be introduced in every department at universities?,
19225,Smeets: Not every academic should do science communication.,
19226,"The aim must not be that everyone does everything, but that everything gets done by someone in academia.",
19227,"But I do think it makes sense to make students aware that there is such a thing as science communication, at the start of their academic career, and that it can offer a career path.",
19228,For this reason we hold guest lectures in bachelor courses at Leiden University.,
19229,"There are also courses on science communication that are part of degree programmes, for example in biology.",
19230,"We want to expand that to other disciplines, in particular those calling for good communication skills.",
19231,And then there is an advanced course in science communication that is offered as a specialisation within existing master’s programmes.,
19232,Those wishing to take this specialisation learn the theory and use evidence-based methods of science communication.,
19233,This aspect is very important to me.,
19234,Science is evidence-based.,
19235,Why should you rely on your gut feeling when aiming to communicate scientific results?,
19236,If you want to work at a scientific level you have to respect certain quality standards.,
19237,It is not enough to do your own thing.,
19238,You have to check whether the outcome is effective.,
19239,The impacts of science communication must be measurable.,
19240,"Ionica Smeets studied Applied Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), obtaining her doctorate from Leiden University in 2010 with a thesis entitled “On continued fraction algorithms”.",
19241,"Appointed as professor there in 2015, she heads the Science Communication and Society research group in Leiden.",
19242,"She has worked as a freelance journalist since 2004, e.g. for the newspaper “de Volkskrant”, in which she also writes a weekly column.",
19243,"At the same time, she introduces scientific topics in many different TV formats.",
19244,"As part of the Nature Marsilius Visiting Professorship for Science Communication at Heidelberg University, Prof. Smeets held lectures as well as various workshops in order to specifically train young researchers in communicating their research to a wider public and contributing to social dialogue.
",
19245,We usually imagine archaeology as investigating historical finds.,
19246,But you devote yourself to the contemporary past and modern material culture.,
19247,What is the reason for dealing with modernity as an archaeologist and why is it so fascinating?,
19248,Dezhamkhooy:,
19249,Archaeology was markedly influenced by the colonialism of the 19th and 20th centuries and there are still conscious or unconscious colonial practices in this discipline.,
19250,"That is shown, for instance, in Egyptology or Near Eastern Archaeology, when researchers in the West study ancient objects that are not available to the local population.",
19251,"In addition, the research topics of archaeology tend to be conservative in the sense that the objects examined are mostly very old, while investigating modernity is still not perceived as belonging to this discipline.",
19252,And yet the archaeology of the present was founded as early as in the 1970s by the American scholar William Rathje.,
19253,It was his aim to develop a line of research concerned with the problems of its own time.,
19254,"As a student, I wanted to find a new access to archaeology going beyond conservative approaches and interpretations, and so I ended up with the archaeology of the present.",
19255,That way I can do research on present-day societies and work on current challenges of humanity.,
19256,"One emphasis of your research is gender archaeology, which is about the role distribution of the genders in a society: what is this line of research about?",
19257,Dezhamkhooy:,
19258,Gender archaeology is very varied and focuses on different topics depending on the context and the period.,
19259,This research field arose in the course of the women’s movements in the 20th century and has since developed into a dynamic subfield of archaeology.,
19260,"As a researcher concerned with the Middle East and particularly with Iran, I’m interested above all in the critical interpretation of contemporary history.",
19261,"Iranian modern states have repeatedly manipulated the representation of the premodern history of the country and its inhabitants, particularly the role of women in society and questions of sexual diversity.",
19262,"The regime under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and, after it fell, the Islamic Republic, have had a great influence on the content of text books – both in the school and the university context.",
19263,"Consequently, official historiography negated the importance of women, as also happened to other oppressed population groups.",
19264,With my research I would like to show that gender and role distribution are dynamic and ahistorical interpretations should be avoided in scholarly work.,
19265,"It is very important for the academic world to spotlight social challenges and problems, and to analyse them scientifically.",
19266,Political structures and power relations are a major part of my research interest.,
19267,In your current research you are also focusing on the Iranian women’s movement at the start of the 20th century.,
19268,You say that there is a false picture of women in Islamic countries in the western world.,
19269,What can we learn from your research for the present situation?,
19270,Dezhamkhooy:,
19271,"First, it must be emphasised that the countries of the East are very diverse and that there is great cultural diversity within a country as well.",
19272,"Unlike the picture projected in the western media, there is no such person as “the” Muslim woman; women in Islamic countries do not form a homogeneous group.",
19273,"If we want to understand the present women’s movement in Iran, we have to consider its historical roots.",
19274,"It is important to me to stress the active role of women in my research, as their engagement for freedom is still neglected.",
19275,Women played a significant role in Iran both during and also after the first democratic revolution in 1906.,
19276,"Historical sources and documents prove that women organised support programmes, founded organisations and companies in order to contribute to the economic, social and political reorganisation of the country.",
19277,During the 1979 Revolution women protested on 8 March – two weeks after the establishment of the Islamic regime – against being forced to wear a hijab.,
19278,"So if you look back at the women’s movements of the past hundred years, the active role of women today comes as no surprise.",
19279,"Society has changed for the better and, after a long struggle for equal rights, women are taking a leading role in the current protests and men are supporting them.",
19280,This is a sign that Iranian society has achieved a certain intellectual maturity.,
19281,"That is a valuable achievement, which has taken over a hundred years.",
19282,"In the past few years people have demonstrated against the regime again and again, but there was less international visibility and attention than there is now.",
19283,What is different about the current situation?,
19284,Dezhamkhooy:,
19285,"The current movement is deeply rooted in past protests – starting from the student protests at the University of Tehran in 1999, which were triggered by a ban on the liberal newspaper “Salam” and called for the protection of civil rights.",
19286,"Then there was what was called the Green movement in response to the result of the Iranian presidential election of 2009, which granted the previous incumbent an absolute majority.",
19287,"Intellectuals, students and the middle classes took part in the public protests and demonstrations.",
19288,"In 2018, 2019 and 2021 there were repeated demonstrations due to the economic crisis and because water shortages as a consequence of climate change were threatening the livelihoods of various population groups, such as farmers, cattle breeders and shepherds.",
19289,The last wave of these demonstrations extended across the whole country.,
19290,"To sum up, three aspects distinguish the current protests from the previous ones: they are taking place in the name of women’s and human rights; the main slogan is “women, life, freedom”.",
19291,Across the country students and other population groups such as teachers and workers are showing solidarity with each other and protesting against the regime together.,
19292,And the protests are lasting longer than earlier demonstrations.,
19293,"Today the movement is determined by the following factors: the extent and duration of the protests, the related demands for women’s and human rights, and the current international interconnection.",
19294,The Ukraine crisis and the role of the Islamic Republic in this war are key factors.,
19295,"In particular, the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic, which is characterised by close relations with China and Russia, opposes the interests of many countries, primarily those of European states.",
19296,"A further factor is the energy crisis, which is currently posing a great challenge to the western world.",
19297,Iran could be a chief supplier of energy since the country has the second biggest gas resources in the world.,
19298,"In my view, Russia’s war against Ukraine and the accompanying energy crisis is impacting strongly on Iran’s domestic situation – both on the current protests and on the future of the Iranian population as a whole.",
19299,The protests rely on the support of the international community and here the political decisions of the European countries play an important role – e.g. relative to energy supplies and sanctions.,
19300,If Iran supplied gas to Europe the regime would profit most from the revenue.,
19301,"Currently, however, Russia has a great influence on the Iranian government and is stopping gas supplies to European countries based on its own interests.",
19302,"The situation is equally complicated regarding sanctions, which are mostly hitting the ordinary population hardest, for example, because they are causing a shortage of medication.",
19303,"Sanctions should not be imposed generally but should aim explicitly at certain individuals in the Revolutionary Guard or groups loyal to the regime, if they are to have any effect.",
19304,What do you expect of the sustained protests for the future?,
19305,Dezhamkhooy:,
19306,The changes in Iran in past years can be described with the words of sociologist Asef Bayat as “the quiet encroachment of the ordinary”.,
19307,This “quiet encroachment” of the ordinary population means a kind of resistance to the power elite that is creeping ahead and is marked by episodic collective actions.,
19308,"Particularly young people, women and minorities are creating more and more space for themselves in the general public.",
19309,"This becomes clear, for instance, through women resisting the regulations of the regime: They allow themselves to be photographed without a hijab and are becoming increasingly visible in the public space.",
19310,"Furthermore, there is more and more discussion about the rights of minorities such as homosexuals.",
19311,That shows that the Iranian population has profoundly changed; many no longer want to go back to earlier times.,
19312,That is putting the government under pressure.,
19313,"Whether this pressure will suffice to bring down the regime is hard to say but in the long term, it doesn’t have a chance, in my opinion – particularly not if there is an increase in pressure from outside.",
19314,The recently adopted United Nations resolution will contribute to that.,
19315,It is intended to enable an independent investigation of the violence used by the Iranian authorities against peaceful demonstrators.,
19316,Maryam Dezhamkhooy studied archaeology at the University of Tehran (Iran) and completed her doctorate there in 2011.,
19317,"In Iran, after teaching commitments at Shiraz Azad University and Larestan Azad University, she worked as assistant professor for archaeology at the University of Birjand for five years until coming to Germany in 2016 as an Alexander von Humboldt fellow.",
19318,"At present, she is an academic staff member of the Käte Hamburger Centre for Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic Studies at Heidelberg University.",
19319,"There, her research is on the concepts of nation and nationality, and the women’s movement in Iran in the recent past.

19320,New astronomical measurements in the infrared range have led to the identification of a heretofore unknown class of asteroids.,
19321,An international research team including geoscientists from Heidelberg University has succeeded in characterising these small planets using infrared spectroscopy.,
19322,They are located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and are – similar to the dwarf planet Ceres – rich in water.,
19323,"According to computer models, complex dynamic processes shifted these asteroids from the outer regions of our Solar System into today’s asteroid belt shortly after their creation.",
19324,"With an equatorial diameter of approximately 900 kilometres, the dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.",
19325,Many other small planets orbit in this region as well.,
19326,“These are the remains of the building materials from which the planets of our Solar System were created four and a half billion years ago.,
19327,"In these small bodies and their fragments, the meteorites, we find numerous relics that point directly to the process of planet formation,” explains Prof. Dr Mario Trieloff from the Institute of Earth Sciences of Heidelberg University.",
19328,The current study shows that the small astronomical bodies originate from all regions of the early Solar System.,
19329,"By means of small bodies from the outer Solar System, water could have reached the still growing Earth in the form of asteroids, because the building blocks of the planets in the inner Solar System tended to be arid, according to Prof. Trieloff, who heads up the Geo- and Cosmochemistry research group.",
19330,The new infrared spectra were measured by Dr Driss Takir at the NASA Infrared Telescope facility at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii (USA).,
19331,"“The astronomical measurements permit the identification of Ceres-like asteroids with a diameter as small as 100 kilometres, presently located in a confined region between Mars and Jupiter near Ceres’ orbit,” explains Dr Takir, astrophysicist at the NASA Johnson Space Center and lead author of the study.",
19332,"At the same time, the infrared spectra support conclusions as to the bodies’ chemical and mineralogical composition.",
19333,"Just like Ceres, there are minerals on the surface of the discovered asteroids that originated from an interaction with liquid water.",
19334,The small astronomical bodies are quite porous.,
19335,High porosity is yet another characteristic shared with the dwarf planet Ceres and an indication that the rock material is still quite original.,
19336,"“Shortly after the formation of the asteroids, temperatures were not high enough to convert them into a compact rock structure; they maintained the porous and primitive character typical of the outer ice planets located far from the Sun,” explains Dr Wladimir Neumann, a member of Prof. Trieloff’s team.",
19337,He was responsible for the computer modelling of the thermal development of the small bodies.,
19338,The properties of these Ceres-like objects and their presence in a relatively narrow zone of the outer asteroid belt suggest that these bodies were first formed in a cold region at the edge of our Solar System.,
19339,Gravitational disruptions in the orbits of large planets like Jupiter and Saturn – or “giant planet instability” – changed the trajectory of these asteroids such that the objects were “implanted” in today’s asteroid belt.,
19340,This was demonstrated through numerical calculations performed by the researchers on trajectory developments in the early Solar System.,
19341,The results were published in the journal “Nature Astronomy”.,
19342,"Scientists from France and the USA contributed to the research, which was funded by the German Research Foundation and the Klaus Tschira Foundation.

19343,Heidelberg University is to acquire a research building to develop innovative engineering science strategies and technologies on the basis of life-inspired molecular systems.,
19344,The German Science and Humanities Council has now expressed its backing for the idea with an outstanding rating.,
19345,This recommendation is the crucial precondition for a new building on the university campus Im Neuenheimer Feld.,
19346,"The building for “Life-inspired Engineering Molecular Systems” (LEMS) will be attached to the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and provide space for an innovative research programme at the interface of engineering sciences, natural sciences and life sciences.",
19347,The Joint Science Conference (GWK) of the federal and state governments will take a final decision on the project entailing an expenditure of approximately 68.4 million euros at the end of June this year.,
19348,"“With its decision, the German Science and Humanities Council has confirmed that our strategy of expanding the engineering of molecular systems is fit for the future.",
19349,"That is a splendid prospect for the university and the colleagues collaborating in this field,” underlines Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Ruperto Carola.",
19350,"In the words of Prof. Dr Christine Selhuber-Unkel, research in this field offers great potential for transfer and translation.",
19351,"“We anticipate that the research conducted in the LEMS building will bring new solutions for societal challenges, particularly in the area of energy-efficient sensor technologies and in medical diagnostics and therapy,” emphasises the scientist, who is the founding director of the Institute for Molecular Systems Engineering and Advanced Materials (IMSEAM) at Heidelberg University and one of the lead applicants for the project.",
19352,"On an area of approximately 3,400 square metres, the new building for “Life-inspired Engineering Molecular Systems” is to provide work areas and laboratories for interdisciplinary research.",
19353,"In the LEMS building, scientists from materials science, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and artificial intelligence will work together across disciplines.",
19354,"Using live models, the aim is to pattern new functional structures which, when implemented technically, enable, for instance, the interaction of cells with synthetic materials at the micro and nano level.",
19355,"In addition, the research programme includes developing polymer-based active materials, engineering and controlling three-dimensional organoids, and immune-engineering, that is, manufacturing modified immune cells and synthetic cell components.",
19356,"The new building is expected to accommodate various pieces of large-scale equipment, including a platform for producing macromolecules, synthetic DNA and DNA-hybrid structures, and artificial genomes.",
19357,"Likewise projected is an imaging platform for visualising cell and material properties on micro and nano scales, and a platform for decoding the proteome of individual cells.",
19358,Half the cost for the new building and its equipment will be covered by the Federal Government and the other half by the State of Baden-Württemberg.,
19359,Construction is planned to start in 2024.,
19360,"The research building will be situated near the IMSEAM buildings, the European Institute for Neuromorphic Computing and the Physics Institutes, as well as the German Cancer Research Center, a close research partner of Heidelberg University.",
19361,"The German Science and Humanities Council, which has now come out in favour of the LEMS research building, is advising the federal and state governments regarding the funding of university buildings.
",
19362,"Five ERC Starting Grants, highly endowed grants of the European Research Council (ERC), have been allocated to Ruperto Carola in the latest approval round.",
19363,"They go to Junior Professor Dr Daniela Duarte Campos, Prof. Dr Kerstin Göpfrich and Dr Stefan Pfeffer, all scientists at the Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University (ZMBH).",
19364,"An ERC Starting Grant has also been awarded to Dr Victoria Ingham from the Medical Faculty Heidelberg, who does malaria research with her research group at the Heidelberg University Hospital.",
19365,"Another grant goes to a research project led by Dr Kathryn Kreckel, based at the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University.",
19366,The ERC is making a total of approx.,
19367,7.5 million euros available for the research projects – 1.5 million euros for each ERC Starting Grant.,
19368,The funding period covers five years.,
19369,Finding a new biotechnological procedure to treat heart failure is the aim of the project “LIGHTHEART – Surgical optogenetic bioprinting of engineered cardiac muscle” led by Daniela Duarte Campos.,
19370,"To achieve this, she will combine bioprinting – new cellular structures are fabricated from body cells and then “printed” – with optogenetics.",
19371,"Using this technology, cellular structures can be assembled with the aid of light.",
19372,"LIGHTHEART is based on the development of an innovative surgical bioprinting tool for fabricating, directly at the heart, muscle tissue engineered from stem cells and assembled under the influence of light.",
19373,"It is intended to supplement traditional transplantation medicine and open new horizons for patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, Prof. Duarte Campos explains.",
19374,"With her ZMBH junior research group she is also involved in the Excellence Cluster “3D Matter Made to Order” (3DMM2O), a joint initiative of Heidelberg University and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.",
19375,The ERC project “ENSYNC – From engineering to evolution of synthetic cells with RNA origami” led by Kerstin Göpfrich deals with the evolution of artificial cells.,
19376,The aim of the research project is to create a prototype of a synthetic cell encompassing a fundamental characteristic of life – the ability to evolve.,
19377,"In the context of ENSYNC, Prof. Göpfrich wants to develop a new molecular hardware based on DNA and RNA origami, i.e. the “art of folding” macromolecules in the nano world, which equip synthetic vesicles with cellular functionality.",
19378,"With their ability to evolve, the functionality of the vesicles and their hardware can be constantly improved.",
19379,"Step by step, an artificial model cell will emerge whose building blocks, in future, could take on specific tasks in a diseased organism, the scientist explains.",
19380,"On 1 November, she took up a professorship at the Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University and continues to lead a research group in the field of biophysical engineering at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research.",
19381,Kerstin Göpfrich also contributes to the research carried out within the 3DMM2O Cluster of Excellence.,
19382,The cellular response to stress is at the heart of the ERC project “RiboStress – Stress-induced structural and organizational adaptations of the cellular translation machinery” led by Stefan Pfeffer.,
19383,It focuses on the cellular processes for synthesising proteins.,
19384,"If they are perturbed under the influence of stress, nascent but also already folded proteins can be destabilised and deprived of their correct function or even aggregate.",
19385,"In his ERC project RiboStress, Dr Pfeffer intends to structurally elucidate how cells react to stress by remodelling the activity, structure and molecular organisation of ribosomes – the cellular machinery of protein synthesis.",
19386,"To do so he uses a cutting-edge approach to high-resolution three-dimensional imaging, termed cryo-electron tomography, which enables visualisation of ribosomes in their native cellular environment at molecular detail.",
19387,Dr Pfeffer is a junior research group leader at the Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University.,
19388,Innovative methods for fighting malaria are the focus of the ERC project “ReMVeC – How has the rapid scale-up of malaria control in Africa impacted vector competence?” led by Victoria Ingham.,
19389,Malaria is caused by parasites transmitted to humans when bitten by infected mosquitoes.,
19390,Insecticides and drugs are the main tools used to fight the infectious disease.,
19391,"Mosquitoes and parasites have, however, developed resistances to them and no longer die as a consequence.",
19392,"In the context of the ReMVeC project, the medical entomologist wants to examine how the different resistances impact the development of the malaria parasites in the mosquito, in order to determine how insecticides and medicines could best be used in regions where malaria is endemic.",
19393,"In addition, Dr Ingham intends to use the stress reaction of mosquitoes to develop new strategies to minimise infection.",
19394,Dr Ingham heads a German Center for Infection Research junior research group at the Center for Infectious Diseases of Heidelberg University Hospital.,
19395,"In her ERC project “ISM-METALS – Tracking galaxy evolution with precise and accurate metal abundances in the interstellar medium”, Kathryn Kreckel uses heavy elements – referred to as “metals” in astronomy – in the interstellar medium to study fundamental processes of galaxy evolution.",
19396,"The life and death of stars produce metals that enrich the interstellar medium – that is, the gas between the stars within a galaxy – with elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.",
19397,"These, in turn, are important for the next stars to form.",
19398,"With the ISM-METALS project, the astrophysicist wants to achieve high-precision metallicity measurements in areas of star formation in the Milky Way and in more distant galaxies using new optical spectra.",
19399,"This is necessary to improve our understanding of measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope, to learn how metals build up over cosmic time.",
19400,"Dr Kreckel heads an Emmy Noether Junior Research Group at the Institute for Astronomical Computing, which is part of the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University.",
19401,"With the ERC Starting Grant the European Research Council supports outstanding young scientists from all disciplines who have already produced excellent work and wish to conduct pioneering research as project leaders.
",
19402,Astronomical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a complex network of structures in nearby galaxies.,
19403,"The infrared images offer a detailed view of stars, gas, and dust and therefore of star formation and galaxy development.",
19404,Two research groups from the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University are crucially involved in analysing the data.,
19405,With their work they are part of a worldwide network comprising more than 100 researchers.,
19406,The latest observations of this so-called PHANGS collaboration form the basis for 21 new research papers that have now been published in “The Astrophysical Journal Letters”.,
19407,"Among other things, the research points to new answers to the question of how young stars impact the development of galaxies.",
19408,The Heidelberg research groups are part of the “Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies” (PHANGS) collaboration.,
19409,"Using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, and the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory, the PHANGS team has been studying 19 spiral galaxies for several years to learn more about the dynamic processes of star formation.",
19410,But the earliest stages of a star’s lifecycle have remained out of view because the process is enshrouded within gas and dust clouds.,
19411,The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its infrared capabilities have changed all that.,
19412,"Infrared radiation penetrates dust and gas, opening up new views into the earliest phases of star formation.",
19413,"Thus far, the PHANGS team has observed five of the 19 galaxies with the Webb telescope.",
19414,The researchers discovered a complex network of structures.,
19415,Glowing cavities of dust and huge cavernous bubbles of gas line the spiral arms.,
19416,In some regions this web of features appears built from both individual and overlapping shells and bubbles where young stars are releasing energy.,
19417,"The JWST was also able to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which play a critical role in the formation of stars and planets, explains Dr Oleg Egorov.",
19418,"He is a member of the research group of Dr Kathryn Kreckel, a junior research group leader at the Institute for Astronomical Computing, which is part of the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University (ZAH).",
19419,"Within the PHANGS collaboration, Dr Kreckel leads the science working group that studies the connection between gas ionisation and star formation.",
19420,"There Dr Egorov uses the Webb telescope to study the properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, something that would have been impossible using ground-based telescopes alone.",
19421,PAH emissions are an indicator of physical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium in which these molecules are ubiquitous.,
19422,Earlier studies had already shown that PAHs are less abundant in regions with ionised hydrogen gas than in neutral zones.,
19423,But why that is remained unclear.,
19424,"“Our measurements suggest that the abundance of PAHs strongly depends on the intensity of the ionising ultraviolet radiation,” states Dr Egorov.",
19425,Dr Elizabeth Watkins studied a single galaxy 30 million light years away.,
19426,"Together with her colleagues, she discovered about 1,700 bubbles or pockets of hot expanding gas using the Webb telescope.",
19427,"The bubbles drive thin shells of colder gas and dust, which appear as holes in the astronomical images.",
19428,"The smallest examples have a diameter of approximately 40 light years, although some reach up to 3,000 light years.",
19429,They were generated by aggregates of young stars.,
19430,"“That tells us something about the conditions needed to form stars in the first place,” states the early-career researcher, who is also a member of Dr Kreckel’s team.",
19431,The research group of Dr Mélanie Chevance likewise uses the JWST data to study star formation processes in galaxies.,
19432,"For the first time, Jaeyeon Kim, a doctoral candidate in Dr Chevance’s group, was able to study star formation deeply embedded in a distant galaxy.",
19433,She identified key environmental factors that are responsible for regulating especially the early phase of star formation.,
19434,"“The radiation of newly formed stars is absorbed by the surrounding interstellar dust and is thus invisible to us,” explains Jaeyeon Kim.",
19435,"The only way to detect this early phase is to study the infrared radiation of the dust, which the Webb telescope now makes possible.",
19436,"Dr Chevance’s research group is located at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, which is also part of the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University.
",
19437,"Along with sugar reallocation, a basic molecular mechanism within plants controls the formation of new lateral roots.",
19438,"An international team of plant biologists has demonstrated that it is based on the activity of a certain factor, the target of rapamycin (TOR) protein.",
19439,"A better understanding of the processes that regulate root branching at the molecular level could contribute to improving plant growth and therefore crop yields, according to research team leader Prof. Dr Alexis Maizel of the Centre for Organismal Studies at Heidelberg University.",
19440,"Good root growth ensures that plants can absorb sufficient nutrients and grow, thus contributing to their general fitness.",
19441,"To do that, they must align the available resources from metabolic processes with their genetic development programmes.",
19442,Plants bind carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere in their leaves and convert it to simple sugars via photosynthesis.,
19443,"In the form of fructose and glucose, these simple sugars are also allocated in the roots, where they drive the growth and development of the plant.",
19444,"Prof. Maizel’s team used the thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant in plant research, to study how this process occurs at the molecular level.",
19445,Their investigations focus on what role glucose plays in forming lateral roots.,
19446,"“We do know that, besides plant hormones, sugar from the shoot is also allocated in the roots, but how the plant recognises that sugar resources are available for forming lateral roots has not been understood thus far,” explains Dr Michael Stitz, a researcher on Alexis Maizel’s team.",
19447,The studies at the metabolism level showed that Arabidopsis forms lateral roots only when glucose breaks down and carbohydrates are consumed in the pericycle – the outermost cell layer of the main root cylinder.,
19448,This process is controlled at the molecular level by the target of rapamycin protein.,
19449,This factor controls critical signal networks and metabolic processes in plants as well as in animals and humans.,
19450,Its activity is governed by the interaction of growth factors like the plant hormone auxin and nutrients like sugar.,
19451,"Using Arabidopsis, the researchers discovered that TOR becomes active in the pericycle cells only when sugar is present there.",
19452,So-called founder cells then form the lateral roots through cell division.,
19453,"Prof. Maizel: “TOR assumes a kind of gatekeeper role; when the plant activates the genetic growth programme responsible for root formation via the hormone auxin, TOR checks whether there are sufficient sugar resources available for this process.”",
19454,"TOR acts by controlling the translation of specific auxin-dependent genes, blocking their expression if there aren’t sufficient sugar resources available.",
19455,"When the researchers suppressed TOR activity, no lateral roots were formed.",
19456,"“That suggests that a fundamental molecular mechanism is involved,” states the Heidelberg plant biologist.",
19457,"At the same time, the researchers demonstrated that TOR controls, via a similar mechanism, the formation of roots from other plant tissues – the so-called adventitious roots.",
19458,"According to Prof. Maizel, the results from their investigations could also be of interest for agricultural applications.",
19459,"“They could potentially be used to develop new strategies for plant growth optimised for various environmental conditions and better crop yields,” emphasises the researcher.",
19460,The research was funded by the German Research Foundation.,
19461,"In addition to the plant biologists from the Centre for Organismal Studies of Heidelberg University, researchers from the University of Strasbourg (France), the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam, the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics in Barcelona (Spain), and University College Cork (Ireland) also contributed.",
19462,"The results of their research were published in “The EMBO Journal”.
",
19463,“The Health + Life Science Alliance is an innovation hotspot where excellent institutions work together and now form a strong alliance.”,
19464,"These were the words of Winfried Kretschmann, State Premier of the state of Baden-Württemberg, speaking at a kick-off event for the Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim in the Marsilius Kolleg of Heidelberg University on Thursday 22 September 2022.",
19465,"Seven outstanding research institutions are collaborating in the research alliance with the goal of building the Rhine-Neckar region into an internationally leading biomedical-technological cluster for life sciences, the health economy and medical technology.",
19466,"The event focused on the current expansion and further plans to develop the alliance, also presenting the initial results of projects connected with its state funding as an Innovation Campus.",
19467,The next step is now the upcoming foundation of a nonprofit limited company.,
19468,"“With an innovative research and development network of outstanding university and non-university centres, along with strong partners in the business community, the Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim is unleashing an immense potential.",
19469,"It will raise patient care to a new level, considerably accelerate the transfer of research findings into industry, sustainably raise the profile of the region and, last but not least, give politicians an instrument to actively participate in shaping science and health policy at the national and international level,” underlined Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Heidelberg University, in his welcoming address.",

19471,He thanked all those involved for their commitment to implementing scientific innovations in practice.,
19472,"Finally the two spokespersons for the research alliance stressed its special features: “The Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim is a pace-maker for innovations and a development catalyst for the Rhine-Neckar region, which, through the planned collaboration, will also become even more attractive internationally,” said Prof. Dr Wolfgang Wick (Heidelberg University Hospital).",
19473,"Prof. Dr Michael Boutros (German Cancer Research Center and Heidelberg University) stated: “The features that will make our health cluster a success include, in particular, the cross-institutional approach, attractiveness for top-talents and integration into the regional economy.”",
19474,"Three scientific conversations followed, with researchers from institutions participating in the alliance dealing with pilot projects being funded through the Innovation Campus Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim.",
19475,"Topics included neurosciences and cancer, molecular engineering and bio-convergence – the connection between medicine, biosciences and data sciences – and knowledge-based spin-offs to boost know-how and technology transfer.",
19476,"The driving forces behind the development, which is rooted in two decades of cooperation, are Heidelberg University, a University of Excellence, with its two Medical Faculties, the German Cancer Research Center, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, the Central Institute of Mental Health and the two University Hospitals in Heidelberg und Mannheim.",
19477,The seven partners form the core of the Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim.,
19478,"They are united in the goal of expanding common priorities in health research, bolstering life science research and intensifying transfer into industry and society.",
19479,"The aim is thereby to create a new leading industry with great traction and high potential for sustainable value creation, together with strong partners from business and the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.",
19480,The state of Baden-Württemberg is giving 10.7 million euros as a first step towards supporting the structural development of the research alliance.,
19481,"Since 2021, three pilot projects of the partners have already received funding worth 40 million euros in the context of the Innovation Campus funding line, e.g. to build joint high-tech platforms or advance the use of artificial intelligence in life sciences.",
19482,"Embedded in a network of start-ups and companies in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, the Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim seeks to further expand its excellent research, along with translation and transfer, by linking outstanding university and non-university research centres with the university’s medical faculties and the university hospitals.",
19483,"Its aim is to become an internationally top-level, globally competitive location for biomedical technology.",
19484,"To lay the foundations for this, the seven partners signed a memorandum of understanding in August 2021, also setting out the decision-making mechanisms and working structures of the alliance.",
19485,"This is now to be implemented institutionally through the founding of a joint limited company.
",
19486,"In order to strengthen innovative research and transfer in the field of Molecular Systems Engineering at Heidelberg University, biophysicist Prof. Dr Daniel J. Müller has been chosen for a Humboldt Professorship endowed with up to five million euros.",
19487,It is granted by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and financed by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.,
19488,Such professorships go to internationally leading scholars working in other countries so that they can pursue long-term cutting-edge research at German universities.,
19489,"At the newly founded Faculty of Engineering Sciences and at the Institute for Molecular Systems Engineering and Advanced Materials (IMSEAM), Prof. Müller – an initiator and pioneer of an engineering approach in biology – is to work on significant issues in bionanotechnology.",
19490,"Currently based at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), the scientist is Ruperto Carola’s nominee for Germany’s most highly endowed international research prize.",
19491,"With his research, Prof. Müller bridges the gap between the life sciences, systems biology and synthetic biology, in order to characterise the way in which inter- and intramolecular interplay controls biological processes.",
19492,"Novel bionanotechnological methods, such atomic force microscopy, make it possible to image cells at nanometre resolution, localise cellular interaction and observe how individual receptors of living cells communicate.",
19493,"Nanoscopic imaging of cells, cellular membranes or membrane proteins will simultaneously allow him to map their physical, chemical and biological properties.",
19494,"At the same time, Prof. Müller’s research group develops and uses nanotechnological instruments to quantify the mechanical properties of cells during fundamental processes such as adhesion, sorting, growth and mitosis.",
19495,In cooperation with colleagues in Basel he recently succeeded in producing efficient tools for genetically reprogramming single neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo.,
19496,"In the person of Daniel J. Müller, Ruperto Carola seeks to attract a scientist to the Heidelberg centre of science and research who has proved himself in the scientific community to be an excellent representative of his research field.",
19497,"Besides the outstanding scientific qualifications of the candidates for a Humboldt Professorship, the strategies of universities play a key role as they are expected to offer the researchers and their teams long-term career prospects in Germany.",
19498,"In appointing Prof. Müller, Heidelberg University aims to develop new approaches to molecular systems engineering from the interaction of molecular life sciences and materials sciences with scientific computing and machine learning in connection with novel hardware designs.",
19499,"Building on Prof. Müller’s experience with spinoffs, Heidelberg University can expand its basic research interfaces in industry.",
19500,That means fostering the translation of findings from the natural sciences into medicine and medical technology and also transfer to industrial applications.,
19501,Daniel J. Müller studied physics at TU Berlin and the Hahn Meitner Institute in Berlin.,
19502,As a doctoral student in the field of biophysics he worked at Forschungszentrum Jülich and the Biozentrum of the University of Basel (Switzerland).,
19503,After obtaining his doctorate in 1997 he also earned his habilitation in Basel in 2000 and then transferred to Dresden.,
19504,"There he was a group leader at the newly founded Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, before accepting a professorship for Cellular Machines in 2002 at the Biotechnology Center of TU Dresden.",
19505,Since 2010 he has taught and pursued his research as Professor for Biophysics at ETH Zurich.,
19506,"Amongst other things, Prof. Müller is a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and has worked on several scientific structural formation projects, including the Swiss National Competence Center in Research (NCCR) Molecular Systems Engineering in Basel.",

19512,"After successful appointment negotiations with the respective universities, the prizes will be awarded next year.
",
19513,“The university is firmly rooted in its long history but it also leaves its imprint on the present.,
19514,"As I see it, the mood is not one of despondency but of new departures,” Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Ruperto Carola, spoke these words in his opening address at the annual ceremony with which Heidelberg University traditionally opens the new Academic Year.",
19515,"In spite of all the crises that had also affected academia, he added, the university was staying on track in order to “meet the challenges proactively”.",
19516,"Members of the university, friends, supporters and alumni had gathered in the Great Hall of the New University on 22 October 2022 to celebrate the university’s 363rd anniversary on this festive occasion.",
19517,"In spite of all the confidence and joy at starting a new semester on campus, the Rector expressed a warning about the consequences of the crisis in energy costs.",
19518,"The university would be given priority in energy supply but, in view of cost increases, would rapidly need a secure financial situation, he said.",
19519,"This would also hold true in view of inflation and pay rises, for instance for employees paid by third-party funding.",
19520,"“The financial resources from the Second University Financing Agreement are melting like snow in the spring sunshine,” the Rector remarked.",
19521,“University finances need to be adapted to the ‘new era’.”,
19522,"In his review of the past academic year, the Rector pointed not only to the successful acquisition of funds to continue the 4EU+ European University Alliance but also to the effective establishment and expansion of new structures within the university.",
19523,"“Our academic quality management is now almost complete,” he stated.",
19524,"The heiQUALITY system encompasses the accrediting of all courses, the promoting of doctoral students and young researchers in the framework of heiDOCS and heiTRACKS, as well as the professional development and training programmes of the heiSKILLS language and competence centre.",
19525,"In the field of transfer, spinoffs and patents, the hei_INNOVATION agency scouts around for innovative ideas and provides support for founding start-ups; together with the limited company ScienceValue Heidelberg GmbH, founded two years ago, they now constitute a ‘pipeline’ through which university intellectual property rights can be exploited efficiently and profitably, Prof. Eitel explained.",
19526,"“In the field of research, the momentum achieved with all of these supporting measures is clearly visible,” the Rector said.",
19527,“We are in the process of giving developments long-term support with new infrastructure projects.”,
19528,"In Prof. Eitel’s view, the Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim is of particular significance.",
19529,"“We are pleased that the state of Baden-Württemberg is now energetically supporting the Innovation Campus; we are pushing this topic,” he said.",
19530,"Besides the amalgamation of the two medical faculties, the merging of the two university hospitals remains a challenge, he added.",
19531,“That needs to be finally decided quickly by the state premier.”,
19532,"With respect to the decision to withdraw next year, before the end of his third term of office, the Rector said: “I have decided to retire from my office to allow for finding a new person able to lead the university into the coming years,” said Prof. Eitel.",
19533,“That is necessary now because the ‘hot’ phase of the Excellence Competition starts at the end of the year.,
19534,"The initiating of strategic decisions, long-term developments and possible changes in university structures can only be advocated for and credibly communicated to the reviewers by the ones who are going to implement such plans.”",

19536,"Under the heading “Scholarship – Freedom – Responsibility” the Heidelberg legal scholar and former federal constitutional court judge Prof. Dr Paul Kirchhof answered questions asked by Heike Schmoll, a journalist at the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.",
19537,"In view of current disputes about, for instance, gender-inclusive language, the cancel culture and controversial agitators, Prof. Kirchhof argued for preserving the fundamental university principle of “proposition and counter-proposition”.",
19538,"He claimed that it must be the constant task of universities to convey this to students, in particular, through “constantly working on rationality”.",
19539,"At the annual celebration, Ruperto Carola continued its tradition of honouring extraordinary commitment to the university and support for the sciences and humanities.",
19540,"By appointing Bettina Hornbach, Dr Tilman Krauch and Markwart von Pentz honorary senators, the Rector underlined, the university was recognising three notable figures who had done much for Ruperto Carola in different ways.",
19541,"“You are important companions of the university and the development of our university,” Prof. Eitel said.",
19542,The Rector then turned to Prof. Dr Louise Gunning-Schepers with the words “You have become a good friend”.,
19543,The internationally noted Dutch scholar with numerous public functions has belonged to the university’s Academic Advisory Council since 2013.,
19544,"The Rector awarded her an honorary doctorate for her exceptional work in this highest advisory body of Ruperto Carola, in order to admit Prof. Gunning-Schepers to the circle of Heidelberg academics.",
19545,The 2022 Klaus-Georg and Sigrid Hengstberger Prize for early-career researchers was also awarded during the annual celebration.,
19546,"Worth 12,500 euros each, the three prizes went to Dr Elisa Fresta and Dr Yan Huang from the Institute for Physical Chemistry, Dr Andreas Sander from the Institute for Astronomical Computing, and to Dr Philipp Uhl and Dr Florian Umstätter, who work in radiopharmaceutical chemistry at the Heidelberg University Hospital.",
19547,The awards came with an opportunity for the prize-winners to hold their own scientific symposia at the International Academic Forum Heidelberg (IWH).,
19548,"The IWH director, chemist Prof. Dr A. Stephen K. Hashmi, gave the laudatory addresses for the five young researchers.",
19549,Prize-donor Dr Klaus-Georg Hengstberger then awarded the certificates.,
19550,Members of the Collegium Musicum – the university orchestra and choir under the baton of University Music Director Michael Sekulla – provided the musical setting for the annual ceremony alongside the Capella Carolina.,
19551,"The choir from the university’s International Study Centre, conducted by Prof. Franz Wassermann, started the programme off by singing the university anthem.",
19552,"Romance scholar Prof. Dr Christof Weiand was the presenter throughout the whole event.
",
19553,"The Hans-Peter Wild Talent Scholarships are an “advance payment on good progress at Heidelberg University,” said University Rector Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel at the ceremony to award the scholarship documents on 23 November 2022.",
19554,Twelve students at the university can enjoy financial support.,
19555,"After the launch of the scholarship programme endowed by entrepreneur Dr Hans-Peter Wild last year, the scholarships have now been awarded for the second time.",
19556,They support gifted young people with enthusiasm and motivation to study what are known as the MINT subjects.,
19557,"In his welcoming remarks, Prof. Eitel praised Hans-Peter Wild as one of the “most loyal friends and supporters of Ruperto Carola” and congratulated the scholarship holders.",
19558,He appealed to the students to take advantage of the many and varied opportunities offered by Heidelberg University: “Develop your own profile here!”,
19559,"As the founder was unable to attend, his greeting was read out.",
19560,"In it, Dr Wild emphasised that he would like to make a long-term contribution to attracting excellent students in the MINT subjects – among the best of their year – to Heidelberg University.",
19561,He was pleased to note that interest in the scholarship had continued to rise.,
19562,While last year saw approx.,
19563,"150 young people applying for the fellowship, this year there had been more than 200 applicants, he said.",
19564,"During the event, Prof. Dr Lavinia Heisenberg gave insights into her career as a scientist and her research area on gravitation.",
19565,The physicist had herself studied in Heidelberg.,
19566,"After her research had taken her to locations all over the world, finally as a professor to ETH Zurich (Switzerland), she came back to Ruperto Carola last year – to teach and continue her research at the Institute for Theoretical Physics.",
19567,"Afterwards, the scholarship holders received their certificates from University Rector Bernhard Eitel.",
19568,"Many of the students developed a great interest in their present subjects while still at school, and participated, for instance, in competitions such as “Jugend forscht” or the International Physics Olympiad.",
19569,"It turned out that they had deliberately chosen Heidelberg University as their place of study because of its good reputation, but also because of the broad range of subjects, offering multiple opportunities for interdisciplinary networking.",
19570,"In the 2022/2023 winter semester, all twelve scholarship holders – seven women and five men – began their bachelor’s or master’s course at Heidelberg University in a MINT subject.",
19571,"Students from all five faculties in the MINT field are receiving support, including the new Faculty of Engineering Sciences.",
19572,"The students come from Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Serbia, Turkey and Indonesia.",
19573,"The Hans-Peter Wild Talent Scholarship, with its monthly payment of 1,000 euros, is granted on a merit basis.",
19574,"Eligible to apply for the respective winter semester are outstanding prospective students from Germany and abroad who wish to complete a degree at Ruperto Carola in mathematics, computer science, one of the natural science disciplines or in the field of technology.",
19575,The funding can be extended beyond two semesters after a successful test of talent and academic performance.,
19576,The goal of the programme is ideally to support the scholarship holders until the end of their course of study.,
19577,"25 students are currently receiving financial support, including the beneficiaries of the first funding round.",
19578,"Entrepreneur and alumnus Hans-Peter Wild is involved in many different ways as a close friend, advisor and provider of generous endowments to Ruperto Carola, including as one of the group of benefactors of the Heidelberg Center for American Studies.",
19579,"In recognition of his long years of service to the promoting of research and teaching at Heidelberg University, the Senate in 1996 conferred on him the status of an honorary senator.",
19580,Dr Wild’s great loyalty to his alma mater was also evident in his commitment during the fundraising campaign ZUKUNFT STIFTEN (fund the future) that ended in 2019.,
19581,"For example, he made funds available to attract outstanding scholars to Heidelberg University and also donated three million euros towards financing the new building of the European Institute for Neuromorphic Computing.
",
19582,"In the course of optimising key procedures of genome editing, researchers from the department of Developmental Biology / Physiology at the Centre for Organismal Studies of Heidelberg University have succeeded in substantially improving the efficiency of molecular genetic methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 and related systems, and in broadening their areas of application.",
19583,"Together with colleagues from other disciplines, the life scientists fine-tuned these tools to enable, inter alia, effective genetic screening for modelling specific gene mutations.",
19584,"In addition, initially inaccessible DNA sequences can now be modified.",
19585,"According to Prof. Dr Joachim Wittbrodt, this opens up extensive new areas of work in basic research and, potentially, therapeutic application.",
19586,Genome editing means the deliberate altering of DNA with molecular genetic methods.,
19587,"It is used to breed plants and animals, but also in basic medical and biological research.",
19588,The most common procedures include the “gene scissors” CRISPR/Cas9 and its variants known as base editors.,
19589,"In both cases, enzymes have to be transported into the nucleus of the target cell.",
19590,"Upon arrival, the CRISPR/Cas9 system cuts the DNA at specific sites, which causes a double strand break.",
19591,New DNA segments can then be inserted at that site.,
19592,Base editors use a similar molecular mechanism but they do not cut the DNA double strand.,
19593,"Instead, an enzyme coupled with the Cas9 protein performs a targeted exchange of nucleotides – the basic building blocks of the genome.",
19594,"In three successive studies, Prof. Wittbrodt’s team succeeded in considerably enhancing the efficiency and applicability of these methods.",
19595,A challenge when using CRISPR/Cas9 consists in the efficient delivery of the required Cas9 enzymes to the nucleus.,
19596,“The cell has an elaborate ‘bouncer’ mechanism.,
19597,"It distinguishes between proteins that are allowed to translocate into the nucleus and those that are supposed to stay in the cytoplasm,” explains Dr Tinatini Tavhelidse-Suck from Prof. Wittbrodt’s team.",
19598,Access is enabled here by a tag made up of a few amino acids that functions like an “admission ticket”.,
19599,The scientists have now come up with a kind of generally valid “VIP admission ticket” which lets enzymes equipped with it into the nucleus very quickly.,
19600,"They have named it “high efficiency-tag”, “hei-tag” for short.",
19601,"“Other proteins that have to penetrate the cell nucleus are also more successful with ‘hei-tag’,” concludes Dr Thomas Thumberger, who is also a researcher at the Centre for Organismal Studies (COS).",
19602,"In cooperation with pharmacologists from Heidelberg University, the team could show that Cas9 in connection with the “hei-tag” ticket can enable highly efficient, targeted genome alterations not only in the model organism medaka, the Japanese ricefish (Oryzias latipes), but also in mammalian cell cultures and mouse embryos.",
19603,"In a further study, the Heidelberg scientists showed that base editors operate highly efficiently in the living organism and are even suited to genetic screening.",
19604,"In an experiment with Japanese rice fish, they were able to show that these locally limited, targeted modifications in individual buildings blocks of the DNA achieve an outcome that is otherwise only obtained by the comparatively laborious breeding of organisms with altered genes.",
19605,"The research team at COS, in cooperation with Dr Dr Jakob Gierten, a paediatric cardiologist at Heidelberg University Hospital, focused on certain genetic mutations.",
19606,These mutations were suspected of triggering congenital heart defects in humans.,
19607,"Through modifying individual building blocks of the DNA of the relevant genes in the model organism, the scientists were able to imitate and study fish embryos with the described heart defects.",
19608,"The targeted intervention led to visible changes in the heart already during early stages of fish embryonic development, say Bettina Welz and Dr Alex Cornean, two of the first authors of the study from Prof. Wittbrodt’s team.",
19609,That enabled the researchers to confirm the original suspicion and establish a causal connection between genetic alteration and clinical symptoms.,
19610,"The precise intervention in the genome of the fish embryos was made possible through especially developed software ACEofBASEs, which is available online.",
19611,It allows for identifying genetic locations that very efficiently lead to desired changes in the target genes and the resultant proteins.,
19612,The scientists say that the Japanese ricefish is an excellent genetic model organism for modelling mutations like those identified from the respective patients.,
19613,"“Our method enables an efficient screening analysis and could therefore offer a starting point for developing individualised medical treatment,” according to Jakob Gierten.",
19614,"A third study, again from the Wittbrodt group, deals with the limitations of base editors.",
19615,"For such an editor to bind the DNA of a target cell, there has to be a certain sequence motif.",
19616,"It is called Protospacer Adjacent Motif, PAM for short.",
19617,"“If this motif is lacking near the DNA building block to be changed, it is impossible to exchange nucleotides,” explains Dr Thumberger.",
19618,A team under his direction has now found a way to get around this limitation.,
19619,Two base editors in a single cell are used in succession.,
19620,"In an initial step, a new DNA binding motif for a further base editor is generated, upon which this second editor, which is applied simultaneously, can edit a site that was inaccessible before.",
19621,"This staggered use turned out to be highly efficient, explains Kaisa Pakari, the first author of the study.",
19622,"With this trick, the Heidelberg scientists were able to increase the number of possible application sites of established base editors by 65 percent.",
19623,Now DNA sequences that were initially inaccessible can also be modified.,
19624,"“Optimising the existing tools for genome editing and their fine-tuned application results in enormously varied possibilities for basic research and, potentially, novel therapeutic approaches,” Joachim Wittbrodt underlines.",
19625,The research findings were published in the journals “eLife” and “Development”.,
19626,"The investigations were part of the research carried out in the “3D Matter Made to Order” Cluster of Excellence, which is run jointly by Heidelberg University and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.",
19627,"The research studies and scientists involved were funded by the European Research Council, the German Research Foundation, the German Centre for Cardiovascular Research, the German Heart Foundation, and the Joachim Herz Foundation.
",
19628,An interdisciplinary winter school is dealing with arguments about cultural and natural heritage.,
19629,The Heidelberg Center for Ibero-American Studies (HCIAS) and Heidelberg University’s Max Weber Institute for Sociology are hosting the event from 27 February to 3 March 2023.,
19630,"The international winter school, with the theme “CLAIMS_2023 – Claims and counterclaims over natural and cultural heritage”, is intended for doctoral candidates and master’s students from the humanities and social sciences.",
19631,"17 participants are expected to attend from Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Peru, as well as France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany.",
19632,"From a transnational perspective, they will deal with the question of what is understood as “heritage”, how it is created and what influence actors from public and private life exert on these phenomena.",
19633,"The participants of the winter school will also discuss the question of who, for what reasons and with what justification, raises a claim to something that, officially or unofficially, is understood as “heritage”.",
19634,These discussions will focus on handling cultural and natural heritage in the culturally and ethnically diverse countries of South America.,
19635,"Researchers from the HCIAS and the Max Weber Institute, and from various other institutes of Heidelberg University, are organising the international winter school, which is being conducted with support from the Flagship Initiative “Transforming Cultural Heritage”.",
19636,"It is taking place on the premises of the International Academic Forum Heidelberg.
",
19637,Heidelberg University scientists are to receive three ERC Synergy Grants – three highly endowed grants of the European Research Council – for pioneering research projects by several teams working in collaboration.,
19638,"With colleagues in Amsterdam and Zurich, cell and molecular biologist Prof. Dr Bernd Bukau is coordinating a trinational group project dealing with new approaches to exploring the biogenesis of protein complexes.",
19639,"Another project coordinator is chemist Prof. Dr Michael Mastalerz who, with partners in Marburg and Tübingen, is aiming to achieve the synthesis of special carbon compounds to form the basis for new classes of materials.",
19640,"In addition, Prof. Dr Anna Marciniak-Czochra (mathematics) and Junior Professor Dr Simon Anders (biostatistics) are involved in another ERC Synergy project focusing on interdisciplinary research into the dynamics and control of neural stem cells.",
19641,It is based at the Heidelberg research hub and is being implemented with the participation of a research team from Paris.,
19642,The European Research Council is funding the three projects over a period of six years to the tune of over 35 million euros; approximately eleven million euros will go to Ruperto Carola.,
19643,The ERC project “Mechanisms of co-translational assembly of multi-protein complexes” (CoTransComplex) centres on the formation of multi-protein complexes in cells.,
19644,Current findings show that these complexes are already formed during their synthesis by several translating ribosomes in a manner that is coordinated in time and space.,
19645,"This is a fundamental process in biology, as most cell proteins do not develop their biological activity until these complexes are formed, and disturbances of these processes are associated with numerous diseases.",
19646,"By elucidating these processes, the researchers involved in the CoTransComplex project hope also to uncover hitherto unknown levels in the control of protein biogenesis, says Bernd Bukau, who coordinates the project.",
19647,He heads the research group “Biogenesis and quality control of proteins” at the Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University (ZMBH) and directs the Chaperones and Proteases division at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).,
19648,"Prof. Bukau is working on the topic of the ERC Synergy Grant alongside Dr Günter Kramer, who is also a member of the ZMBH.",
19649,Partners in the CoTransComplex team are biophysicist Prof. Dr Sander Tans of the AMOLF research institute on the physics of functional complex matter in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and molecular biologist,
19650,Prof.,
19651,Dr Nenad Ban from ETH Zurich (Switzerland).,
19652,"Funding of about 13 million euros is available for the research activities, with approximately 3.9 million euros going to Ruperto Carola.",
19653,The project “Tackling the cyclacene challenge” (TACY) is concerned with a special class of polyaromatic carbon compounds known as cyclacenes – smallest segments of carbon nanotubes.,
19654,"Due to their unique chemical, electronic and structural properties, these compounds are of fundamental interest for potential applications in organic electronics, for instance.",
19655,"Despite decades of efforts, it has not yet been possible to synthesise them, something the researchers now intend to achieve through new approaches in the context of the TACY project.",
19656,"Cyclacenes form the basis for entirely new classes of materials that could be used in different technological areas, project coordinator Michael Mastalerz explains.",
19657,"An expert on the organic synthesis of nanodimensional molecules, his teaching and research takes place at the Institute of Organic Chemistry of Ruperto Carola; in the TACY team he cooperates with Prof. Dr Michael Gottfried (interface chemistry and nanosciences) from the University of Marburg and Prof. Dr Holger Bettinger (physical organic chemistry) from the University of Tübingen.",
19658,"The European Research Council is funding the project with approximately eleven million euros, of which about 3.3 million have been allocated to the research work at Heidelberg University.",
19659,The ability of stem cells to renew themselves and to differentiate is at the centre of the project “PerPetuating Stemness: From single-cell analysis to mechanistic spatio-temporal models of neural stem cell dynamics” (PEPS).,
19660,"In order to create new cells as needed, the body possesses several systems of what are known as stem cells.",
19661,"These stem cells are able to divide, either to produce the required cells or to restore the stem cell reservoir.",
19662,The PEPS project will investigate for the vertebrate brain how the balance between these two processes is maintained over the life span through complex interactions between the cells involved.,
19663,"To this end, the researchers will develop and combine experimental methods with data analysis and mathematical modelling.",
19664,Two teams from Heidelberg University are making significant contributions to this research.,
19665,Prof. Marciniak-Czochra heads the research group “Applied Analysis and Modelling in Biosciences” at the Institute for Applied Mathematics and is a member of the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing.,
19666,Prof. Anders does research at the BioQuant Center with his group “Biostatistics for Omics Data”.,
19667,"The project is coordinated at the German Cancer Research Center by Prof. Dr Ana Martin-Villalba, who heads the DKFZ Division of Molecular Neurobiology and also has a professorship at Heidelberg University.",
19668,Biologist Dr Laure Bally-Cuif is involved via the Institut Pasteur in Paris (France).,
19669,"The ERC is making available approximately eleven million euros for the PEPS project, with almost 3.8 million going to fund the work at Ruperto Carola.",
19670,"The ERC Synergy Grants fund collaborative projects that, due to their complexity, are carried out by several scientists and their groups, in order to achieve breakthroughs that would not be possible in individual projects.",
19671,"For this purpose, the European Research Council allocates grants of up to ten million euros, in special cases also up to 14 million.",
19672,"The ERC Synergy projects may take up to six years.
",
19673,The Collaborative Research Centre “Vascular Control of Organ Function” (CRC 1366) at Heidelberg University will continue its successful work for another four years.,
19674,"After a positive evaluation, the application for extension for a second funding period has now been accepted in the latest approval round of the German Research Foundation (DFG).",
19675,This biomedical consortium is receiving DFG funds worth approx.,
19676,14.3 million euros.,
19677,It is based at the Medical Faculty Mannheim of Ruperto Carola; Prof. Dr Hellmut Augustin continues as spokesperson for CRC 1366.,
19678,Heidelberg physicists are also involved in the CRC/Transregio “Phenomenological Elementary Particle Physics after the Higgs Discovery” coordinated in Karlsruhe.,
19679,The CRC/TRR 257 is also entering a second funding stage.,
19680,"The research in CRC 1366 focuses on the mechanisms by which blood vessels control organ function during development, adult homeostasis and in disease processes.",
19681,"Directly or indirectly, vascular malfunctions are involved in a large number of deaths.",
19682,"Consequently, the goal is to better understand the processes behind life-threatening diseases and identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention by decoding complex vascular functions at the cellular and molecular level.",
19683,"The researchers mainly study the blood vessels in the brain, heart, lung, liver, and tumours.",
19684,"The focus is on the gatekeeper and regulatory functions of organ-specific endothelial cells, which line the interior of the blood vessels, and mural cells that cover the capillaries and small veins.",
19685,"In the transition from the first to the second funding period, CRC 1366 has incorporated new topics.",
19686,Besides the functional diversity of endothelial cells in physiological and pathological situations these include the rapidly developing field of vascular aging research.,
19687,"The Collaborative Research Centre “Vascular Control of Organ Function” involves scientists from the two Medical Faculties in Mannheim and Heidelberg, the Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University and the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg.",
19688,"Also participating in the CRC are research groups from Bad Nauheim, Bonn, Göttingen, Frankfurt, Munich and Münster.",
19689,Prof. Augustin directs the Department of Vascular Biology and Tumor Angiogenesis at the Medical Faculty Mannheim and is one of the two directors of the European Center for Angioscience (ECAS).,
19690,CRC/TRR 257 links up with the discovery of the Higgs particle in 2012.,
19691,"Cosmological and astrophysical observations indicate that, while the standard model of particle physics is structurally consistent, there must be further particles and interactions beyond this model.",
19692,Systematically testing these questions with the data of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s biggest particle accelerator at the CERN research centre in Geneva (Switzerland) – calls for high-precision predictions based on fundamental quantum field theory.,
19693,"In these theory-based predictions, scientists working in the Collaborative Research Centre/Transregio “Phenomenological Elementary Particle Physics after the Higgs Discovery” play a leading role worldwide.",
19694,Prof. Dr Tilman Plehn and Dr Anja Butter from the Institute for Theoretical Physics are participating in the CRC/TRR 257 from Heidelberg University.,
19695,They are working on global analyses in which all LHC data is systematically examined for deviations from the Higgs sector of the standard model or the entire standard model.,
19696,A new Heidelberg emphasis in the second funding round is applications of artificial intelligence on LHC simulations and as a basis for new LHC analytical methods.,
19697,The DFG is making funds worth approx.,
19698,15.9 million euros available for a period of four years.,
19699,"Besides the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Heidelberg University, the consortium also includes scientists from RWTH Aachen University and the University of Siegen, which are co-applicants.

19702,"In remembrance of the gun attack exactly a year ago the university choir gave a memorial concert in the Great Hall of the New University, beginning with an organ prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach.",
19703,"This “commemoration without words” was attended by approximately 400 people, including family members, relatives and friends of the student killed during the shooting, numerous members of the university and students, as well as state, city and police representatives.",
19704,"Under the baton of University Music Director Michael Sekulla, around 100 choristers from the university choir performed a moving work of mourning, consolation and hope.",
19705,"The soloists were Johanna Beier (soprano) and Matthias Horn (baritone), with organ accompaniment by Maria Mokhova.",
19706,“The terrible gun attack last year has not been forgotten; it will remain engraved in the memory of the university.,
19707,"In particular, though, I’d like to highlight the strength and community spirit displayed after the shooting,” says Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Heidelberg University.",
19708,"“The University and the Rectorate will continue to stand by all those concerned with great sympathy and care, so that the academic community can go on shouldering the consequences of the attack on 24 January 2022 together.",

",
19710,Viruses like influenza A and Ebola invade human cells in a number of steps.,
19711,"In an interdisciplinary approach, research teams from Heidelberg University and Heidelberg University Hospital investigated the final stages of viral penetration using electron tomography and computer simulations.",
19712,"In the case of influenza A, they were able to determine how the immune system fights off the virus using a small protein.",
19713,"For Ebola viruses, they discovered that a specific protein structure must be disassembled in order for an infection to take hold.",
19714,"So-called fusion pores, through which the viral genome is released into the host cell, play a central role in these processes.",
19715,"If they can be prevented from forming, the virus is also blocked.",
19716,"The Heidelberg scientists describe previously unknown mechanisms, which might lead to new approaches to prevent infections.",
19717,Many viruses that infect humans are covered with a lipid membrane that has glycoproteins that can dock with human cells.,
19718,"In viruses like influenza A, which enter through the respiratory tract, these are the spike proteins that mainly bind to epithelial cells in the nose and lungs.",
19719,"In contrast, the highly infectious Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with infected bodily fluids and can penetrate a broad spectrum of cell types.",
19720,"After invading human cells, these viruses must open a fusion pore between the virus membrane and the host membrane to release their genome into the host cell and propagate.",
19721,"To fight off the virus, the human immune system attempts to block the formation of the fusion pore in a multi-stage process.",
19722,"Infected cells sense the presence of the foreign genome and send a signal, in the form of an interferon molecule, to as yet uninfected cells.",
19723,This signal triggers the uninfected cells to produce a small cellular protein called interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3).,
19724,"“This specialised protein can effectively prevent viruses such as influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, and Ebola from penetrating, but the underlying mechanisms were unknown,” states virologist Dr Petr Chlanda, whose working group belongs to the BioQuant Center of Heidelberg University and the Center for Integrative Infectious Disease Research of Heidelberg University Hospital.",
19725,"The researchers were now able to demonstrate that for influenza A viruses, IFITM3 selectively sorts the lipids in the membrane locally.",
19726,This prevents the fusion pores from forming.,
19727,“The viruses are literally captured in a lipid trap.,
19728,"Our research indicates that they are ultimately destroyed,” explains Dr Chlanda.",
19729,"To analyse the structural details of viruses, Dr Chlanda and his team took advantage of equipment from the Cryo-Electron Microscopy Network at Ruperto Carola.",
19730,"In an interdisciplinary approach, the research groups led by Prof. Dr Ulrich Schwarz of the BioQuant-Center and the Institute for Theoretical Physics along with Prof. Dr Walter Nickel of the Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center predicted this process with the aid of computer simulations.",
19731,"In the context of antiviral therapy, the researchers believe it is possible to develop lipid-sorting peptides that insert themselves into the virus membrane, rendering the viruses incapable of membrane fusion.",
19732,"“Such peptides could be used in a nasal spray, for example,” states Petr Chlanda.",
19733,"In a second study, the Heidelberg researchers investigated the penetration and fusion of the Ebola virus.",
19734,The filamentous morphology of the virus is determined by a flexible protein envelope known as the VP40 matrix protein layer.,
19735,"“It has always puzzled us how this long virus could penetrate the cell, fuse with the membrane, and release its genome,” states Dr Chlanda.",
19736,"Using their structural analysis of infected but inactive cells provided by collaborators from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Greifswald, the researchers discovered that this virus protein envelope disassembles at a low pH, i.e. in an acidic environment.",
19737,"This step is not least decisive for the formation of fusion pores, as further computer simulations by Prof. Schwarz and Prof. Nickel showed.",
19738,"During this process, the electrostatic interactions of the VP40 matrix with the membrane are weakened, thereby reducing the energy barrier of pore formation.",
19739,The results of the Heidelberg basic research suggest that a blockade of the disassembly of this layer would be one way to maintain Ebola viruses in a state that does not permit fusion pore formation.,
19740,"Similar to the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus would then be lured into a trap from which it could not escape.",
19741,The studies were part of the Collaborative Research Centre “Integrative Analysis of Pathogen Replication and Spread” (CRC 1129) funded by the German Research Foundation.,
19742,"The research results were published in both “Cell Host & Microbe” as well as the “EMBO Journal”.
",
19743,"Innovative engineering approaches to research and teaching are at the core of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, which Heidelberg University founded with the aim of pooling its technical and scientific expertise and expanding its range of research and subjects in an area of competence that is developing dynamically.",
19744,"After its founding at the start of the last winter semester, the new faculty is now to be officially opened at an Academic Ceremony hosted by the Rector of Ruperto Carola in the Great Hall of the Old University on 30 September 2022.",
19745,"Complementing the traditional engineering disciplines, the new faculty offers an original profile of skills in the field of Engineering Sciences.",
19746,"The cooperation of molecular life sciences, biophysics and biochemistry with scientific computing and machine learning, in connection with novel hardware models, will give rise to new engineering approaches promoting translation from natural sciences into medicine and medical technology, as well as transfer to industrial applications.",
19747,"Examples are biogenic packaging systems for mRNA vaccines, artificial cells as transport systems in the body or a new fibre battery technology, which conducts electricity more efficiently and enables higher currents.",
19748,"Other engineering examples are “portable” technologies such as exoskeletons, which support people with lifting or walking and can prove useful in industry, rehabilitation or for generally providing support and assistance.",
19749,At present the Faculty of Engineering Sciences has 26 professorships with around 350 scientists.,
19750,"They carry out their research at the Institute of Computer Engineering (ZITI), at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), the Institute for Molecular Systems Engineering and Advanced Materials (IMSEAM), the Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology (IPMB), the BioQuant Center and the Center for Molecular Biology of Heidelberg University (ZMBH) – backed up by scientists from other interdisciplinary research centres.",
19751,"In terms of teaching, the new faculty offers interdisciplinary bachelor’s and master’s programmes in molecular biotechnology, the state examination programme in pharmacy, the Master-PhD programme Matter to Life in the context of the Max Planck School of the same name, and the master’s programme in computer engineering.",
19752,"Further study programmes are being planned in connection with mathematics and computer science, as also in the field of bioengineering and medical technology.",
19753,"Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Heidelberg University, will open the Academic Ceremony to inaugurate the Faculty of Engineering Sciences.",
19754,The festive event will centre around a scientific panel on the topic “Engineering sciences?,
19755,What for and where to?,
19756,The new faculty presents itself”.,
19757,"Participants are doctoral student Franziska Grün (IPMB), Junior Professor Dr Daniela Duarte Campos (ZMBH), Prof. Dr Frauke Gräter (IWR) and Prof. Dr Holger Fröning (ZITI).",
19758,"The discussion will be facilitated by the founding dean, Prof. Dr Guido Kanschat, who is a member of the Managing Board of Directors of the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing.",
19759,The Academic Ceremony to officially inaugurate the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at Heidelberg University is taking place on 30 September 2022 in the Great Hall of the Old University and begins at 4pm.,
19760,"Media representatives are warmly invited to attend and report.
",
19761,What did the Universe look like more than 12 billion years ago when the first galaxies were forming?,
19762,To tackle this early cosmic epoch a new junior research group started work this October at Heidelberg University’s Institute for Theoretical Physics.,
19763,"Led by Dr Caroline Heneka, the research team will connect modern machine learning methods and artificial intelligence with large-scale intensity mapping measurements at multiple wavelengths or colours.",
19764,The primary goal is an integrated understanding of astrophysical processes and cosmology at play during this early epoch of our Universe.,
19765,"The Volkswagen Foundation is supporting the studies of the cosmologist and astrophysicist with a Freigeist Fellowship for six years, which comes with funding totalling approximately 1.1 million euros.",
19766,“The very first brightly radiating galaxies allow important conclusions about their properties and interaction with each other.,
19767,"At the same time, they offer us clues on how such astrophysical structures arise in our Universe,” Dr Heneka explains.",
19768,"Instead of precisely measuring single cosmic objects, which can only succeed for a fraction of all galaxies at early times, the project of the Heidelberg physicist aims for a new kind of image-based surveying of the sky.",
19769,Dr Heneka combines complex computer simulations with astronomical observations encompassing large-scale intensity mappings.,
19770,She and her team will analyse the resultant two and three-dimensional images with methods of the so-called Computer Vision Astrophysics.,
19771,"This will include the use of artificial neural networks, which are a foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning.",
19772,In 2013 Caroline Heneka completed her master’s degree in physics at Heidelberg University and in 2017 earned her doctorate in physics and astronomy at the Dark Cosmology Centre of the University of Copenhagen (Denmark).,
19773,"Dr Heneka then was a fellow at Heidelberg University and the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa (Italy), and worked as a research employee at the German Aerospace Center.",
19774,"Most recently, she led research activities related to machine learning at Hamburg Observatory, which is part of Universität Hamburg, as a postdoc in the “Quantum Universe” Excellence Cluster.",
19775,The Freigeist Fellowship of the Volkswagen Foundation supports early-career researchers from all disciplines.,
19776,"They need to have not just outstanding scientific expertise but also to look beyond the boundaries of their own disciplines, combining a talent for critical analysis with new perspectives and innovative solutions.",
19777,"13 scientists across Germany are receiving support in the present funding round.
",
19778,"During the Covid pandemic, scientists attracted unprecedented public attention – both positive and negative.",
19779,"Against this backdrop, in a lecture at Heidelberg University, Dr Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim is presenting her insights on the consequences of this field of tension.",
19780,The multiple award-winning science journalist is the Nature Marsilius Visiting Professor at Ruperto Carola in the winter semester.,
19781,Her lecture “Superstar scientists – how hype and hate are changing science communication” is taking place (in German) on 8 December 2022 as an on-campus event open to all members of the university in the Great Hall of the New University.,
19782,It will be live streamed for the general public from 7.30 p.m.,
19783,"The streaming will be accessible via heiONLINE, which is the central portal of Ruperto Carola with lectures, panel discussions and events in digital formats on www.uni-heidelberg.de/de/heionline.",
19784,“Who is your favourite virologist?,
19785,"Around 2020 / 2021 that was a common question in small talk,” says Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim.",
19786,"“Before the Covid pandemic you looked in vain for scientific experts in TV chat shows on political issues, whereas suddenly no programme could manage without virologists, who turned into public figures.”",
19787,"For the Nature Marsilius Visiting Professor, this creates a dilemma: without public attention science communication is fruitless, yet public attention can also hinder an objective communication of scientific content.",
19788,"This is because both hype and hate lead, she says, to mixtures of facts and personal attitudes.",
19789,"In her presentation Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim will discuss this field of tension and explain why, in her eyes, there is “pre-Covid science communication” and “post-Covid science communication”.",
19790,"The Nature Marsilius Visiting Professorship for Science Communication is a joint initiative of Holtzbrinck Berlin, the Klaus Tschira Foundation and Heidelberg University.",
19791,It involves inviting well-known experts to the university to hold their own courses on what makes for high-quality reporting about scholarly research and scientific findings.,
19792,"At the same time, the visiting professors are expected to spark a broad-based discussion about new forms of exchange between academia and the public.",
19793,Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim studied chemistry at the University of Mainz and spent time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.,
19794,"She did doctoral research at RWTH Aachen University, Harvard University in Cambridge / Massachusetts and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research in Potsdam.",
19795,Her studies of intelligent materials for biomedical applications earned her a doctorate from the University of Potsdam in 2017.,
19796,"Since then, Dr Nguyen-Kim has been active in many different ways as a science journalist and science communicator, for instance with her ZDFneo science show “MAITHINK X”, ZDF series “Terra X” and “maiLab” for funk, the content network of ARD and ZDF.",
19797,"The popular science author – her book, “Die kleinste gemeinsame Wirklichkeit”, examines societal controversies through the lens of science – was voted science journalist of the year in 2018 and has been awarded many prizes.
",
19798,What aftereffects did National Socialism have on women attracted to women after 1945?,
19799,This is the focus of an interdisciplinary research project being carried out by academics from the universities of Heidelberg and Freiburg.,
19800,"With the aid of lesbian biographies, they want to explore whether and to what extent the aftermath of Nazi dictatorship is to be seen as a radical change for lesbian life worlds.",
19801,This involves devoting themselves to the urgent task of securing contemporary testimonies from lesbian women in southwest Germany.,
19802,They are intended to span the immediate post-war period to the early 1980s.,
19803,"The Baden-Württemberg science ministry is funding the project, under the leadership of Prof. Dr Katja Patzel-Mattern and Prof. Dr Karen Nolte (Heidelberg) and Prof. Dr Sylvia Paletschek (Freiburg), at a cost of approximately 660,000 euros for two years.",
19804,"Through the research project “Between Invisibility, Repression and Lesbian Emancipation – Women loving Women in the German Southwest from 1945 to the 1980s”",
19805,"the researchers aim to reveal not only the aftereffects of National Socialism but also the hitherto unresearched everyday life of homosexual women, the conditions in which they lived and the political beginnings of the lesbian movement.",
19806,The project continues a preceding project that was also funded by the science ministry and concerned itself with lesbian life worlds between 1920 and 1945.,
19807,It is divided into three sub-projects that link up with the content of the research results.,
19808,"“Our studies have shown that women who did not match the contemporary norms of femininity were also sanctioned in the German Southwest – through social contempt, supervision by the authorities and forced medical intervention.",
19809,"And yet women defied the repression in all political systems and led their lives beyond the hetero norm,” emphasises Prof. Patzel-Mattern.",
19810,"“We now intend to deepen these aspects by giving those concerned a voice through interviews with contemporary witnesses and, in that way, saving their experiences as an important part of the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.”",
19811,"Using biographies of lesbian women in politics, society and culture, Prof. Paletschek and Muriel Lorenz from the Department of History at the University of Freiburg want to highlight the performance and achievements of women in these fields who were attracted to women and did not live by hetero norms.",
19812,"Prof. Patzel-Mattern and Elena Mayeres, who follows Mirijam Schmid as project co-worker, are investigating perceptions of the hetero norm, which defines heterosexuality as the social norm, and its legal enforcement.",
19813,"In particular, they are examining the criticisms to which women, mothers, girls and daughters were exposed if they did not live by this norm.",
19814,The researchers work at the Department of History at Heidelberg University.,
19815,"Prof. Nolte und Steff Kunz will reconstruct the way female homosexuality was documented in psychiatric hospitals and the extent to which, after 1945, there was a break in dealing with non-heteronormative women in psychiatric institutions.",
19816,They belong to the Institute for Medical History and Ethics at Ruperto Carola.,
19817,"For the National Socialist period in the preceding project, the oral history method of interviewing contemporary witnesses – that is, conducting open interviews focusing on memories and biographical history – was no longer possible.",
19818,"However, this can still work for the post-war period up until the early 1980s, and it is urgent since this generation has meanwhile reached a considerable age, too.",
19819,The researchers are therefore looking for contemporary witnesses to serve as interview partners for the research project.,
19820,"The project is supported by the Office for Equal Opportunity of the City of Heidelberg, which is, amongst other things, financing an accompanying series of events.",
19821,"The series is being put together in cooperation between the research institutions concerned, the Queer Festival, the round table on sexual and gender diversity, and the LGBTIQ+ coordination centre.
",
19822,"With medical technology and clinical medicine, Heidelberg University is among the best representatives of the respective subject worldwide.",
19823,"In the 2022 Global Ranking of Academic Subjects, medical technology improves by three places over last year, being ranked 14th internationally and second in Germany.",
19824,"Clinical medicine – in 17th position internationally – takes the top position in Germany, as it did last year, a level also achieved by a second medical discipline, public health.",
19825,"Public health is in 45th place on the international scale, having improved by four places over 2021.",
19826,"Another excellently placed medical discipline in the Shanghai Subject Ranking is pharmacy, which has leapt forward by eleven places worldwide to 30th position (last year 41st).",
19827,That means ranking second at the national level.,
19828,"In the natural sciences, physics at Heidelberg is among the 50 best representatives of this subject internationally, being placed 44th and ranking second in Germany.",
19829,"For the first time, the biological sciences are also among the top 50 worldwide, having climbed to 49th position from the 51-to-75 group, corresponding to third position Germany-wide.",
19830,"Also classed under life sciences, human biological sciences confirm their Top 50 placing of last year, with an international improvement by two places from 49th to 47th position.",
19831,"In Germany, human biological sciences take fifth position.",
19832,"Biotechnology, which comes under the Engineering subjects, is in second position nationally and in the 51-to-75 group internationally.",
19833,"In all, Heidelberg University features in the 2022 Global Ranking of Academic Subjects with 28 disciplines, being placed seven times in the Top 50 internationally and a total of ten times in the Top 100.",
19834,"The Subject Ranking appeared in July 2022 and is part of the Academic Ranking of World Universities, also called the Shanghai Ranking.",
19835,It covers a total of five academic areas to which the ranked subjects are assigned.,
19836,"The ranking is mainly based on publication data, with the prizes and awards won at a university also counting for most subjects.",
19837,"There are five indicators in all, weighted differently depending on the discipline.",
19838,"In the overall Shanghai Ranking published last year, Heidelberg University took third place in Germany, ranking 18th in Europe and 57th internationally.
",
19839,"The top position in Germany and the 27th internationally – an improvement of seven places over the last year – is held by Heidelberg University’s Life Sciences, according to the 2022/2023 Times Higher Education World University Ranking by Subject.",
19840,"Medicine has also performed exceptionally well and maintained its prior-year position, ranking second at the national and 38th at the international level.",
19841,The Physical Sciences likewise earn top placements in their subject group.,
19842,They are ranked 34th internationally and third in Germany.,
19843,The Times Higher Education (THE) Ranking by Subject puts the Arts and Humanities at Ruperto Carola in 35th place and they rank fifth in the Germany-wide evaluation.,
19844,"In the Life Sciences, Heidelberg University is followed at the national level by Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) in second place and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in third place; internationally they rank 33rd (LMU) and 35th (TUM).",
19845,"In medicine, called Clinical and Health in the THE Ranking by Subject, Ruperto Carola is positioned between Charité – University Medicine Berlin (internationally ranked 26th) and LMU, which is ranked 46th in the international evaluation.",
19846,"While Psychology was not listed in the subject ranking last year, it has now made it back into the “Top 100” (in 91st place) and ranks seventh in Germany.",
19847,"Placed 43rd in the Times Higher Education World University Ranking, Heidelberg University is one of the “Top 50” universities worldwide and, after TUM and LMU Munich, is one of the three best universities in Germany.",
19848,The criteria of the Ranking by Subject correspond to those of the overall THE Rankings but are weighted differently for each subject group.,
19849,"The calibration depends on various indicators in the five areas: teaching, research, citations, international outlook and income from industry.
",
19850,The decision on a new rector as the head of Heidelberg University will be taken at a joint meeting of the Senate and the University Council of Ruperto Carola.,
19851,"The election will take place on 9 March 2023; for that purpose, the members of the two electoral bodies will assemble in the Great Hall of the Old University.",
19852,"The quarter-hour presentation of each of the candidates for the office of rector and the election with the announcement of the election result will be open to the university public, that is, to members of the university.",
19853,"The candidates’ presentations will most probably start as of 11.30 am, with interruptions for consultations by the electoral bodies in closed session.",
19854,The election will then take place during the afternoon.,
19855,"Due to the limited seating capacity of the Great Hall, the respective parts of the joint meeting of the Senate and the University Council that are open to the university public will also be live streamed to the Senate Hall in the Old University and the lecture theatre of the Marsilius Kolleg on the Im",
19856,Neuenheimer Feld campus.,
19857,Viewing the transmission is also restricted to the university public.,
19858,"The election became necessary after the present incumbent Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel announced in May last year that he would end his third period of office as Rector of Heidelberg University prematurely, on 30 September 2023.",
19859,His successor will therefore assume the office as head of Ruperto Carola from 1 October.,
19860,"The appointment will be made by the state premier of Baden-Württemberg.
",
19861,"With a view towards predicting the consequences of human-made climate change for Mediterranean ecosystems, Earth scientists from Heidelberg University have studied natural climate and vegetation fluctuations of the past 500,000 years.",
19862,Their primary focus was the effects of these fluctuations on the forests in the Mediterranean region.,
19863,"To this end, researchers led by Dr Andreas Koutsodendris analysed fossil pollen preserved in a sediment core from Greece.",
19864,Their investigations suggest that in long-standing drought conditions – as the latest climate models predict – desertification of the forests in the Mediterranean region is likely in the near future.,
19865,"Mediterranean forests are not only hotspots of biodiversity, but they also provide critical ecosystem services.",
19866,"They protect against soil erosion, regulate the regional climate and hydrological conditions, and supply food and timber.",
19867,"“Because they are exceptionally sensitive to climate change, concern for their survival is growing in light of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and associated global warming,” explains Dr Koutsodendris.",
19868,"He is a member of the research group of Prof. Dr Jörg Pross, which investigates the Earth’s environmental and ecosystem dynamics at Heidelberg University’s Institute of Earth Sciences.",
19869,"To trace how Mediterranean forests reacted to climate changes in the past, the Heidelberg researchers, in cooperation with colleagues from France, Germany, Greece, and the United Kingdom, took drill cores from Tenaghi Philippon – a terrestrial climate archive in the northeast of Greece – that provide a complete record of the past 500,000 years, and in which fossil pollen grains are preserved.",
19870,The data on vegetation development in this period gained from the pollen grains was correlated with geochemical data on contemporaneous fluctuations in precipitation.,
19871,"The results of the team led by Dr Koutsodendris show that, in the past, the Mediterranean forests transformed into steppes within a few decades as soon as specific precipitation thresholds were crossed.",
19872,"Using ecological models, the scientists also examined possible factors that caused precipitation patterns to change.",
19873,Their analyses show that changes in atmospheric CO2 content influence the amount of precipitation in the Mediterranean region.,
19874,"“In the past, a decrease in rainfall of 40 to 45 percent was sufficient to set off a sudden shift from forest to steppe biomes under natural conditions,” explains Dr Koutsodendris.",
19875,"These results imply that such a shift could lie ahead for the forests of the Mediterranean region in the near future if nothing is done to protect them, the Heidelberg Earth scientist states.",
19876,"Funding for the research was provided by the German Research Foundation, the State of Hessen in the context of its state initiative for the development of scientific and economic excellence, and the Wilhelm Schuler Foundation.",
19877,The research results were published in the journal “Nature Communications”.,
19878,"A. Koutsodendris, V. Dakos, W. J. Fletcher, M. Knipping, U. Kotthoff, A. M. Milner, U. C. Müller, S. Kaboth-Bahr, O. A. Kern, L. Kolb, P. Vakhrameeva, S. Wulf, K. Christanis, G. Schmiedl, J. Pross: Atmospheric CO2 forcing on Mediterranean biomes during the past 500 kyrs.",

19880,"In the context of the Metropolink Festival, a new mural – designed by Mexican street artist Saner – is currently being painted on the gymnasium wall of the Heidelberg Julius Springer School.",
19881,The outline for the painting shows eight Tetzáhuitl – omens for the end of the world from precolonial cultures in the territory of present-day Mexico − which Saner combines with modern perspectives in his work.,
19882,"The idea for this action came from the research project of the art historian and anthropologist Prof. Dr Adolfo Mantilla Osornio, a visiting scholar at the Käte Hamburger Centre for Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic Studies at Heidelberg University.",
19883,The painting will be inaugurated on 6 August 2022 at a public event.,
19884,"Parallel to the creative process, visitors can view an exhibition featuring the painting’s individual motifs.",
19885,Interchange with the public and with artists plays an important role in the research of the Käte Hamburger Centre for Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic Studies (CAPAS).,
19886,"CAPAS director Prof. Dr Robert Folger underlines that art is of twofold relevance, since it both expresses and forms cultural ideas on the end of worlds.",
19887,"“That can combine many different regional, historical and scholarly perspectives, as is shown in Saner’s work.”",
19888,"The mural “Post-apocalyptic Visions of the 12th book” is based on a narrative about the destruction of societies, drawn from a mid-16th century text handed down in the indigenous Nahuatl language.",
19889,It describes eight omens for the end of the world heralding upheavals in the lives of individuals and the community.,
19890,"Originally shaped by the indigenous perspective, the omens referred to in the painting are, however, the product of a transcultural vision that also resonates with apocalyptic ideas in Europe.",
19891,"Furthermore, the illustrator, graphic designer and street artist Saner, whose real name is Edgar Flores, weaves motifs of current social and political discussion into his mural in order to enable a contemporary access to the worldviews, myths and narratives of the historical text.",
19892,The idea of cooperating with the Mexican artist came from Prof. Mantilla Osornio.,
19893,"As a visiting scholar at CAPAS he studies apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic representations in the art of Mexico, from the 16th century to the present.",
19894,"An art historian and anthropologist, who has been the academic director of the Mexico Academy of Art since 2017, he also curated the exhibition with individual motifs from the mural with the relevant historical and scholarly background notes, which can be seen on the Festival grounds in Patrick Henry Village.",
19895,The completed mural on the gymnasium wall at the Julius Springer School will be inaugurated on 6 August.,
19896,The general public is warmly invited; it begins at 6pm.,
19897,"Short introductions will be given by artist Saner, as well as Adolfo Mantilla, as the curator, Robert Folger, CAPAS director, and Pascal Baumgärtner, curator of the Metropolink Festival.",
19898,"The work of the Käte Hamburger Centre for Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic Studies at Heidelberg University focuses on how disasters and apocalyptic scenarios impact on societies, individuals and environments.",
19899,"The aim is to give a nuanced description of past and present systemic upheavals, differentiating and distinguishing them from one another, on the basis of a transdisciplinary research approach.",
19900,"To that effect, around ten international visiting scholars from different disciplines come to work at CAPAS every year.",
19901,The centre is funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research.,
19902,"For the mural project, CAPAS is cooperating with Metropolink, Festival for urban art, that creates new perspectives on the city and beyond.",
19903,"Artistic interventions in the public space open up opportunities to regain these places for the community, as has happened since 2018 with Patrick Henry Village (PHV), a former residential area of the United States army in Heidelberg.",
19904,"Art and urbanity form the thematic core of Metropolink, that – with close cooperation on topics of culture and modern urban development – plays a central role in the development of PHV as a new, 16th district of Heidelberg.",
19905,"The Käte Hamburger Centre for Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic Studies is participating in this year’s festival programme with various other events, e.g. an open-air film series and panel discussions with the CAPAS fellows.
",
19906,The phenomenon of regeneration was discovered over 200 years ago in the freshwater polyp Hydra.,
19907,"Until now, however, it was largely unclear how the orderly regeneration of lost tissues or organs is activated after injury.",
19908,"In its investigations of Hydra, an interdisciplinary research team at Heidelberg University was able to show how wound healing signals released upon injury are converted into specific signals of pattern formation and cell differentiation.",
19909,Essential components are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and the Wnt signalling pathway – molecular mechanisms that have remained relatively unchanged throughout evolution.,
19910,The ability to regenerate varies widely in animals.,
19911,"Most mammals and vertebrates have only limited regeneration capacity, while basal and simple animals that emerged early in evolution, like cnidarians and planarians, can regenerate their whole body.",
19912,"In all cases, the process of regeneration begins with wound healing.",
19913,The cells at the site of injury proliferate and form an undifferentiated mass – a blastema – from which the missing structures are re-patterned.,
19914,This activates genetic processes that also control embryonic development.,
19915,"To determine the molecular mechanisms involved, the research team led by Prof. Dr Thomas W. Holstein studied the freshwater polyp Hydra to understand the basic features of this activation of regeneration.",
19916,The core of their investigations is the doctoral thesis of Anja Tursch.,
19917,She repeated the key experiment of Geneva naturalist Abraham Trembley (1710 to 1784) which led him to discover the regeneration phenomenon.,
19918,"The Hydra polyp is bisected, prompting the upper half to regenerate a new “head” and the lower half a new “foot” – hence totally different body parts can grow from the exact same tissue at the cut surface in the middle.",
19919,"Building on their previous work on Hydra regeneration, the researchers at the Centre for Organismal Studies (COS) of Heidelberg University have now shown how this is possible.",
19920,"Regardless of where it occurs, any damage triggers nonspecific signals for an injury response, i.e. wound healing, via calcium ions and the production of reactive oxygen species.",
19921,"The signals are transmitted intracellularly by three mitogen-activated protein kinases – p38, JNKs, and ERK.",
19922,Activation of these three molecules is required for both head and foot regeneration.,
19923,Wnt signalling pathways are then activated that are important during embryonic development for the formation of rudimentary organs and the body axis.,
19924,The generic signals of wound healing are thus transferred into position-specific signals of patterning and cell differentiation for regeneration.,
19925,"“Our experiments show that the Wnt signalling pathway is a main component of the initially general injury response and, depending on signal strength, directs the tissue toward head or foot development,” explains Prof. Holstein.",
19926,"This is why, in the case of MAPK inhibition, the otherwise absent regeneration can be induced by artificially generated, recombinant Wnt proteins.",
19927,"“It was also surprising that in middle body parts that had both head and foot removed, heads can be induced at both ends in this way,” adds Dr Suat Özbek, a member of Prof. Holstein’s “Molecular Evolution and Genomics” research group at the COS.",
19928,"Wnt/β-catenin, one piece of the Wnt signalling pathway, was already known to encode positional information for new head structure formation.",
19929,"In collaboration with mathematicians led by Prof. Dr Anna Marciniak-Czochra, the research team of Prof. Holstein and Dr Özbek developed a model that shows how basal positional information in the tissue transforms the initially undifferentiated injury response into a differential patterning process via the Wnt signalling pathway.",
19930,"“Because MAPKs and Wnts are highly evolutionarily conserved, this mechanism is likely deeply embedded in our genome, which is important for regenerative processes in vertebrates and mammals as well,” stresses Thomas Holstein.

19931,"The newly founded Faculty of Engineering Sciences at Heidelberg University has awarded its first doctoral degree to Dr Christine Arndt, a materials scientist.",
19932,She completed her doctorate in the 2022 summer semester with the defence of her thesis.,
19933,"At a short ceremony on 30 January 2023 Dr Arndt received the doctoral certificate from Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel, Rector of Heidelberg University, and Prof. Dr Guido Kanschat, Dean of the Faculty.",
19934,"Certificates conferring the new doctoral degree in engineering, the Dr.-Ing., were also presented to Dr Christian Ritter and Dr Praveen Narasu, who successfully completed their doctoral examinations in the current winter semester.",
19935,"“Through founding the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, Heidelberg University has impressively demonstrated its internal strength and capacity for renewal.",
19936,"The fact that it was possible to award the first three doctoral degrees, the Dr.-Ing., within such a short time indicates the attractiveness of this new research profile,” the Rector said.",
19937,"Even though over 1,200 dissertation projects are successfully completed at Ruperto Carola each year, he added, the first-ever awarding of doctoral degrees in engineering will be recorded in the annals of the university.",
19938,"In her dissertation entitled “Microengineered conductive scaffolds for cell-based actuation”, Dr Arndt presents manufacturing processes for artificial 3D cell scaffolds providing the necessary deformability to accommodate muscle cell contraction and the electrical conductibility to enable cell-to-cell signalling.",
19939,Both of these are vital aspects in 3D cell tissue culture and biohybrid robotics.,
19940,Her research work was supervised by Prof. Dr Christine Selhuber-Unkel at the Institute for Molecular Systems Engineering and Advanced Materials.,
19941,"Dr Ritter’s doctoral thesis focuses on the analysis of fluorescence microscopy images for virus research, with PD Dr Karl Rohr from the BioQuant Center as first reviewer.",
19942,"Dr Narasu, whose doctorate in engineering was earned at the Faculty of Chemistry and Earth Sciences, investigated nanoparticle synthesis in flame spray in his dissertation.",
19943,His supervisor was Prof. Dr Eva Gutheil from the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing.,
19944,"The two Faculties belong to the Combined Faculty of Mathematics, Engineering and Natural Sciences at Heidelberg University.",
19945,"Founded in 2021, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences offers an original profile of skills in the field of Engineering Sciences that complements traditional fields of engineering disciplines.",
19946,"New engineering approaches arise from the cooperation of molecular life sciences, materials science and biochemistry with scientific computing and machine learning in connection with novel hardware models.",
19947,"That particularly promotes the translation from the natural sciences into medicine and medical technology, as well as transfer into industrial applications.",
19948,"Examples include biogenic packaging systems for mRNA vaccines, artificial cells as transport systems in the body, or a new fibre battery technology, which conducts electricity more efficiently and enables higher currents.",
19949,"Other examples are “portable” technologies like exoskeletons, which support people with lifting or walking and can be used in industry, rehabilitation or for further supportive assistance.

19950,"In order to strengthen its strategic cooperation and enable joint growth, the 4EU+ European University Alliance has launched two new interuniversity funding programmes.",
19951,"With the two calls for application, the alliance aims to bolster links between the seven partner universities, make room for new ideas and support cross-university projects linking up students, university teachers and researchers in the framework of a European comprehensive research university.",

20030,"Although just cute little creatures at first glance, the microscopic geckos and octopuses fabricated by 3D laser printing in the molecular engineering labs at Heidelberg University could open up new opportunities in fields such as microrobotics or biomedicine.",
20031,The printed microstructures are made from novel materials – known as smart polymers – whose size and mechanical properties can be tuned on demand and with high precision.,
20032,These “life-like” 3D microstructures were developed in the framework of the “3D Matter Made to Order” (3DMM2O),
20033,"Cluster of Excellence, a collaboration between Ruperto Carola and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).",
20034,"“Manufacturing programmable materials whose mechanical properties can be adapted on demand is highly desired for many applications,” states Junior Professor Dr Eva Blasco, group leader at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and the Institute for Molecular Systems Engineering and Advanced Materials of Heidelberg University.",
20035,"This concept is known as 4D printing, and the additional fourth dimension refers to the ability of three-dimensionally printed objects to alter their properties over time.",
20036,One prominent example of materials for 4D printing are shape memory polymers – smart materials that can return to their original shape from a deformed state in response to an external stimulus such as temperature.,
20037,The team led by Prof. Blasco recently introduced one of the first examples of 3D printed shape memory polymers at the microscale.,
20038,"In cooperation with the working group of biophysicist Prof. Dr Joachim Spatz, a scientist at Ruperto Carola and Director at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, the researchers developed a new shape memory material that can be 3D printed with high resolution both at the macro and at the microscale.",
20039,The structures produced include box-shaped microarchitectures whose lids close in response to heat and can then be reopened.,
20040,"“These tiny structures show unusual shape memory properties at low activation temperatures, which is extremely interesting for bioapplications,” explains Christoph Spiegel, a doctoral researcher in the working group of Eva Blasco.",
20041,"Using adaptive materials, the researchers succeeded in a follow-up study in producing much more complex 3D microstructures like geckos, octopuses, and even sunflowers with “life-like” properties.",
20042,These materials are based on dynamic chemical bonds.,
20043,The Heidelberg researchers report that alkoxyamines are particularly suitable for this purpose.,
20044,"After the printing process, these dynamic bonds allow for the complex, micrometric structures to grow eight-fold in just a few hours and to harden, while maintaining their shape.",
20045,"“Conventional inks do not offer such features,” emphasises Prof. Blasco.",
20046,"“Adaptive materials containing dynamic bonds have a bright future in the field of 3D printing,” adds the chemist.",
20047,Materials scientists at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) also participated in the research on adaptable materials with “life-like” properties.,

20049,A rock glacier in Tyrol – a downward flowing ice-debris mixture covering more than 40 hectares – is becoming unstable due to rising temperatures and is accelerating towards the valley.,
20050,A research team from Heidelberg University is involved in the study of the rock glacier “Äußeres Hochebenkar” in the Ötztal Alps of Austria.,
20051,The geoinformation scientists led by Prof. Dr Bernhard Höfle used terrestrial laser scanning and 3D drone data to collect measurements that contribute to decoding the complex dynamics of this permafrost landform.,
20052,"With the aid of newly developed algorithms, the data on the movement and destabilisation can be analysed more precisely.",
20053,"Rock glaciers a type of permafrost that can form massive, kilometre-long ice-debris flows.",
20054,The individual blocks of the downflowing ice-debris mixture can be as large as a small car and can move several tens of metres per year.,
20055,The movement and changes of the “Äußeres Hochebenkar” rock glacier in Tyrol have been measured and monitored since the 1950s.,
20056,"Using terrestrial laser scanning and 3D drone data, Prof. Höfle and his 3D Geospatial Data Processing (3DGeo) research group at Heidelberg University’s Institute of Geography have been collecting measurement data from the rock glacier front since 2015.",
20057,The debris-rock surface is scanned centimetre by centimetre and then digitally recorded in 3D. Regular measurements allow detailed changes to be identified and can help to decipher the complex and as yet not fully understood dynamics of this type of permafrost.,
20058,"To support their investigations, the Heidelberg University geoinformation scientists developed new algorithms that automatically and correctly derive multiple directions of movement and more precise movement rates from the data-rich 3D laser scanning point clouds.",
20059,This makes it possible for the first time to identify overlapping processes of surface change and to link the changes with potential causes.,
20060,"“For example, we can determine whether material is moving downwards, as in a landslide, or if subsurface ice is being lost at the same time,” explains Vivien Zahs, a doctoral candidate and research fellow in the 3DGeo research group.",
20061,The three-dimensional change maps compiled by the Heidelberg researchers are a component of an interdisciplinary project.,
20062,"In collaboration with the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW), the University of Innsbruck (Austria), and the University of Zurich (Switzerland), other observations such as meteorological data were included in the analyses.",
20063,They are based on a 70-year study of the entire rock glacier.,
20064,"The investigations show that the flow velocity of the “Äußeres Hochebenkar” rock glacier has increased sharply as a result of rising temperatures, states Prof. Höfle.",
20065,The relatively new and local dataset from his research group provides new insights into the processes that take place at the front of the rock glacier.,
20066,"This knowledge is important, for example, in managing the increasing risks of rock falls on a major access road for Alpine huts further up the valley.",
20067,The new algorithms have been integrated into the open-source software “py4dgeo” in collaboration with the Scientific Software Center of Heidelberg University.,
20068,This tool for analysing geographical changes is openly available to researchers worldwide.,
20069,The 3D data from the Tyrolean rock glacier are also continuously published as open data.,
20070,"This will allow comparisons of local rock glacier studies and various locations in the Alps.

20082,It is based at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) and the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University.,
20083,"The team, led by Dr Tobias Buck, will combine cutting-edge methods of machine learning with high-resolution cosmological computer simulations in order to gain new scientific insights into the origin of galaxies.",

20089,It offers young scientists the opportunity to set up their own interdisciplinary research group and to implement research projects at the interface between different MINT disciplines.,
20090,"Tobias Buck studied at Heidelberg University where, in 2018, he gained his doctorate in the field of astrophysics.",
20091,"After that, he obtained a postdoctoral position at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam.",
20092,"There, in the Cosmology and High-Energy Astrophysics section, he explored the physical processes leading to the emergence of galaxies with the aid of astronomic observations and computer simulations.",
20093,"He is especially interested in galaxies similar to the Milky Way, as well as their satellite galaxies.",

",
20097,"In the brain of adult mammals neural stem cells ensure that new nerve cells, i.e. neurons, are constantly formed.",
20098,"This process, known as adult neurogenesis, helps mice maintain their sense of smell.",
20099,A research team led by Dr Francesca Ciccolini at the Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences (IZN) of Heidelberg University recently discovered a second stem cell population in the mouse brain.,
20100,"This new type of stem cell, and not the one previously known, is primarily involved in the production of new neurons in the olfactory bulb of adult mice.",
20101,"Until now, scientific investigations on neurogenesis have concentrated on the so-called apical stem cells.",
20102,"“They were long considered to be the only stem cell population in the adult mouse brain as well as the main driver of nerve cell formation,” explains Dr Ciccolini.",
20103,These neural stem cells are located in the subventricular zone near the lateral cerebral ventricle.,
20104,"They were once believed to form the precursor cells that then differentiate in the olfactory bulb of mice into interneurons, nerve cells that modulate stimuli transmission between interconnecting neurons.",
20105,The Heidelberg researchers were able to disprove the single stem cell type theory and the assumption that apical stem cells are responsible for neurogenesis.,
20106,"Originally, the researchers in the Neurobiology department were investigating how this allegedly lone stem cell population in the mouse brain behaves in various situations.",
20107,They used genetically modified animals whose neural stem cells were dyed green using a dye active in the cell nucleus.,
20108,The neurobiologists were surprised to discover that most of the green cells did not display the known characteristics of apical stem cells.,
20109,"“At first, we thought that they could be astrocytes, helper cells that ensure that the neurons are able to do their work.",
20110,"But after we conducted a number of function analyses, it rapidly became clear that these had to be a separate stem cell population,” stresses Dr Ciccolini.",
20111,Further studies showed that the newly discovered stem cell type differs from the known population in its morphology as well as its function.,
20112,This type of cell has no contact with the lateral cerebral ventricle and is therefore called basal.,
20113,The researchers determined that the basal – and not the apical – stem cells are responsible for the formation of neurons in the olfactory bulb.,
20114,"To prove this, they separately labelled both cell populations and then observed whether labelled neurons turned up in the olfactory bulb.",
20115,"“This only happened when the basal population was labelled,” explains Francesca Ciccolini.",
20116,"When only apical stem cells were labelled, no new labelled neurons could be detected in the olfactory bulb.",
20117,The Heidelberg scientists also found out that both stem cell types and precursor cells in the mouse brain communicate with one another via so-called notch interactions.,
20118,"A receptor of the same name plays a vital role, controlling the speed at which the cells multiply and monitoring the cell differentiation process.",
20119,"“The notch activity decides, as it were, whether a stem cell remains a stem cell or develops into a nerve cell,” explains Katja Baur, a doctoral researcher in Francesca Ciccolini’s working group.",
20120,"“We suspect that the apical stem cells intervene in the activation of the notch signal pathway and can inhibit proliferation and neurogenesis,” she adds.",
20121,"Amongst other things, that prevents the depletion of the stem cell reservoir.",
20122,"“Our discovery that another stem cell type exists in the mouse brain of adult animals throws new light on the processes of neuron formation,” emphasises Dr Ciccolini.",
20123,The human brain has similar stem cells that are involved in the formation of brain tumours.,
20124,"The Heidelberg researchers hope that their work will also shed new light on the development and possible treatment of such tumours.

20153,"Käthe Leichter (1895–1942), who did her doctorate with the eminent sociologist Max Weber, was a social scientist and pioneer of the modern women’s movement; she was involved in political resistance to the Nazi dictatorship and a victim of National Socialist persecution.",
20154,Now a new centre for doctoral candidates at Heidelberg University is being named after her.,
20155,"The Käthe Leichter Forum – centrally located on the Im Neuenheimer Feld campus – is intended to be a place of advice and encounter with a specific university profile for the over 8,700 doctoral candidates at Ruperto Carola.",
20156,They are to receive greater visibility as a status group both inside and outside the university.,
20157,University Rector Prof. Dr Bernhard Eitel will perform the opening ceremony for the new centre on 13 December 2022 in the presence of Käthe Leichter’s son Franz and his daughter Kathy.,
20158,"Käthe Leichter, née Pick, is closely linked with the changeful history of Heidelberg University in the 20th century.",
20159,"Born in 1895 into a well-to-do Jewish family, she began studying governance and public policy at the University of Vienna.",
20160,She transferred to Ruperto Carola for the 1917/1918 winter semester.,
20161,Here she studied under the sociologist and national economist Max Weber and earned her doctorate in summer 1918 in the field of political economy.,
20162,"In the 1920s she headed the Women’s Affairs Office of the Vienna Chamber of Labour and, using modern methods, conducted research on the living and working conditions of women.",
20163,"In 1934, following the rise of a fascist regime in Austria, Käthe Leichter fled to Switzerland, along with her husband, the journalist Otto Leichter, and their sons Heinz and Franz.",
20164,"The couple returned, however, and became involved in political resistance.",
20165,"Whereas Otto Leichter managed to flee to the United States with their two sons after the “Anschluss”, the annexation of Austria to National Socialist Germany in 1938, Käthe Leichter was arrested by the Gestapo, sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp for female prisoners in 1940 and killed in the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in March 1942.",
20166,"In the wake of her arrest by the Gestapo, Heidelberg University revoked Käthe Leichter’s doctoral degree.",
20167,"After the end of National Socialism this academic title was restored to her in 1946 by the Senate of Ruperto Carola in an act of annulment: the Nazi practice of withdrawing doctorates for political reasons – and that was the case with Käthe Leichter – had to be “regarded as annulled”, the Senate stated.",
20168,"In November 2014, while visiting Heidelberg, her son Franz Leichter, who lives in the United States, received a facsimile of the doctoral certificate, which Rector Bernhard Eitel presented to him in a symbolic gesture.",
20169,Today Käthe Leichter is regarded as one of the pioneers of the modern women’s movement – particularly in Austria.,
20170,"The new centre in the building INF 370 contains the Graduate Academy, the central coordinating body for all transdisciplinary services related to general advising, professional and academic development and financial assistance for doctoral candidates at Heidelberg University.",
20171,"Also located here is the Doctoral Convention, which represents the interests of doctoral candidates within and outside the university.",
20172,“Heidelberg University has set out to find new ways of supporting doctoral candidates.,
20173,"These include, in particular, the optimising of all general conditions that will lead to the excellent scholarly development of young researchers in their doctoral phase; that is also expressed in the establishment of the Käthe Leichter Forum,” says Prof. Eitel.",
20174,"There are currently over 8,700 doctoral candidates at Ruperto Carola.",
20175,"According to the latest survey of the Federal Statistical Office, published in summer this year, this is the highest number at any university in Germany.",
20176,"The Rector of Heidelberg University will speak at the opening of the Käthe Leichter Forum, addressing questions of quality assurance in connection with support for young researchers.",
20177,"Dr Helke Hillebrand, director of the Graduate Academy, will report on its work.",
20178,"Then Joey Rauschenberger, a doctoral student at Ruperto Carola’s Department of History, will give a short talk on Käthe Leichter.",
20179,"The music for the opening ceremony will be provided by members of the Collegium Musicum, the university orchestra.

20180,Tailor-made chemical complexes of certain elements from the group of metals could be suitable for use in a special way in medical imaging as well as potential applications in personalised precision medicine.,
20181,This has been demonstrated by a research team led by Prof. Dr Peter Comba at the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry of Heidelberg University.,
20182,"In their basic research, the Heidelberg scientists worked with manganese, lutetium, and actinium ions.",
20183,Their work focussed on ligands with a so-called bispidine scaffold.,
20184,These compounds are extremely rigid and can bind metal ions with great stability and selectivity.,
20185,"In their work with manganese, a transition metal with special properties such as the ability to boost the contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the research team synthesised three different bispidine ligands and their manganese(II) complexes.",
20186,"They exhibit complex stabilities up to ten billion times greater than those of zinc(II), the major competitor of manganese(II) in biological systems.",
20187,"According to Prof. Comba, these compounds are especially well suited as contrast agents in MRI because they do not exchange the manganese ions for zinc ions in animals and humans.",
20188,"Until now, gadolinium(III) substances were used almost exclusively for this purpose.",
20189,"In recent years, however, safety concerns have increased because free gadolinium(III) ions are toxic, the chemist explains.",
20190,“This is also true for free manganese(II) ions.,
20191,"However, because manganese, unlike gadolinium, is essential for the human body, there are natural mechanisms that can remove manganese(II) from the body.",
20192,"Further developing these substances for clinical applications can thus be a worthwhile goal,” states Comba.",
20193,He reports that the quality of initial MRI images in mice with one of the manganese complexes developed in Heidelberg is comparable to the results attained in images with a clinically tested gadolinium contrast agent.,
20194,"In addition to these new manganese-selective ligands, Dr Patrick Cieslik also developed a bispidine scaffold that forms very stable complexes with the metals lutetium-177 and actinium-225.",
20195,This ligand is a so-called bifunctional chelator (BFC) with a dual function and is therefore part of a modular system.,
20196,A BFC can bind with a radioactive metal ion as well as be coupled to a biological vector such as an antibody to detect specific molecules or tissues in the body.,
20197,In this instance the BFC was coupled to a peptide that can locate tumour cells in the body.,
20198,Such a chemical complex – also called a conjugate – can be marked with radionuclides that are important in imaging or treatment.,
20199,"“We were able to demonstrate that our conjugates, with the medically important radionuclides lutetium-177 and actinium-225, exhibit similarly good properties as conjugates with DOTA, a bifunctional chelator already in clinical use,” explains Dr Cieslik, who conducted research for his doctoral thesis in Prof. Comba’s team.",
20200,"“The major advantage of the BFC that we developed is that, unlike DOTA systems, it can be labelled with radioactive metal ions very quickly and under mild conditions.",
20201,"Conjugates can thus be used with very sensitive antibodies that could be relevant for diagnosis and treatment in personalised medicine,” explains Patrick Cieslik.",
20202,The research results were published in two papers in the “Journal of the American Chemical Society”.,
20203,"Besides the Heidelberg team, other scientists from Germany and France contributed to the research work.",
20204,"The work was supported by the German Research Foundation and the Max Planck School Matter to Life.

20205,"[Zircon crystals, like a time capsule, can preserve traces of life hundreds of millions of years old in the form of biogenic carbon.",
20206,"Using new methods, geoscientists at Heidelberg University have succeeded in tracing very old and rare examples of the mineral zircon that host graphite inclusions in which light carbon is identifiable as a remnant of earlier life.",
20207,"According to the researchers, this opens up new possibilities for research into our planets early period for which neither fossils nor sediments have been preserved in their original form.",
20208,", Zircon mineral grains form from magma, i.e. melted rock, in an extremely hot and intrinsically hostile environment.",
20209,Yet heated remnants of organisms were converted to carbon dioxide and methane gases and deposited as graphite in the mineral zircon at approximately 700°C.,
20210,"“The special isotopic signature of biogenic carbon remains largely preserved in most inclusions and leaves behind a kind of fingerprint of earlier life forms”, explains the studys lead author Dr Manfred Vogt at the Institute of Earth Sciences at Heidelberg University.,",
20211,"Taking the measurements is extremely demanding, emphasise the researchers.",
20212,"First, intact graphite inclusions, some measuring just a few micrometres and thus a hundred times finer than a human hair, must be found and identified within zircon crystals.",
20213,"To exclude contamination with carbon from the environment, non-destructive Raman microspectroscopy is used to examine the encapsulated inclusions in place in the zircons.",
20214,"Next, the zircons are bombarded with an ion beam to expose the graphite inclusions so that their carbon isotopic composition can be analysed.",
20215,"In this process, we can remove only a few nanometres of thick carbon layers and measure them individually, thus obtaining many data points for a single inclusion to detect possible variations, explains Dr Winfried Schwarz, a participant in the study.",
20216,"Zircons are among the oldest minerals on Earth, some older than four billion years.",
20217,“They can teach us about well over 96 percent of the Earths history.,
20218,"For the first hundred million years, these crystals represent the only known record holding information on very early conditions on the planet.",
20219,"Inclusions in these oldest zircons have already revealed that water and oceans existed on Earth early on, as well as movements of the continental plates”, explains Dr Vogt., The results of the research were published in “Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta”.",
20220,"Two researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (USA), also contributed to the work, which was funded by the German Research Foundation and the Klaus Tschira Foundation.

20223,"The prize, worth 3,000 euros, serves to support young researchers and is awarded jointly with the university.",
20224,"In her dissertation, Dr Jamann studies the axon initial segment (AIS), which, as the first section of the axon – a nerve-cell extension – plays a fundamental role in conducting impulses in neurons, and has so far received little research attention.",
20225,"In the barrel cortex, which is a specific area of the mouse cerebral cortex, she examined the extent to which the AIS can adapt its structure and function to differing levels of activity, and what cellular and molecular mechanisms determine this process.",
20226,"In the words of the referees, Dr Jamann’s thesis, which was assessed “summa cum laude”, distinguishes itself by its particular originality, methodological excellence and scientific relevance.",
20227,"In it the prize winner presents foundational results of significance for future studies on cortical plasticity and neuronal network functions in humans, as well.",

20256,"Starting from the expertise of area studies, the RTG’s research will concentrate on three macro-regions and their interrelations: these are Europe, Asia and the Middle East.",
20257,"“Exploring the ambivalences of enmity in and between these macro-regions will contribute to expanding the knowledge of enmity research beyond the European perspective,” Prof. Penter underlines.",
20258,"Forming the basis for this is Heidelberg expertise in transcultural studies – a field of research that systematically examines the interlocking relations between countries, regions, cultures and religions.",
20259,"In the Research Training Group “Ambivalent Enmity”, the researchers at Heidelberg University will work closely with colleagues from the Heidelberg Center for Jewish Studies.",

20275,Two superfluids can exist at the same time in ultracold atomic clouds.,
20276,"Until now, their coexistence could not be observed experimentally.",
20277,"Now, however, physicists from Heidelberg University have demonstrated such a magnetic quantum fluid – it is fluid in two ways – in an atomic gas.",
20278,Researchers led by Prof. Dr Markus Oberthaler have succeeded in preparing this state in clouds of ultracold rubidium atoms and to characterise it in detail.,
20279,The results of their research were published in the journal “Nature Physics”.,
20280,Fluids as we know them from daily life do not flow without resistance.,
20281,"Large pumps and turbines are needed to move water, and honey flows slowly off a spoon.",
20282,"This is caused by the fluid’s inner friction, through which motional energy is ultimately converted into heat.",
20283,This can be radically different in a quantum fluid – something that is closely linked to the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation.,
20284,A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a special quantum mechanical state of an atomic gas that is reached at very cold temperatures.,
20285,A cloud of individual atoms in this state collectively behaves as a single fluid.,
20286,This quantum fluid is able to flow without resistance – it is superfluid.,
20287,"According to Prof. Oberthaler, in recent decades atomic Bose-Einstein condensates were created from very different types of atoms such as sodium and rubidium, but more recently also from more “exotic” atoms like erbium and dysprosium.",
20288,"However, most of these atoms also exhibit internal degrees of freedom – they have a spin and behave like small magnets.",
20289,"This can, in principle, also give rise to the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation, but this has not been experimentally observed yet, as Markus Oberthaler, a researcher at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics, explains.",
20290,This demonstration has now become possible with an ultracold cloud of rubidium atoms.,
20291,"Usually, a Bose-Einstein condensate is prepared through so-called evaporative cooling.",
20292,This works much like the cooling of coffee in a cup by blowing on it.,
20293,The fastest atoms at the surface of the coffee are blown away and one waits until the remaining atoms come to rest at a cooler temperature.,
20294,"This is extremely difficult for the spin, which is why the Heidelberg physicists chose another method.",
20295,“We initialised the system far from equilibrium and waited until the rubidium atoms reached a new state of equilibrium.,
20296,"What at first seemed less intuitive turned out to be extremely efficient,” states Dr Maximilian Prüfer.",
20297,The study’s lead author was a member of Prof. Oberthaler’s research group and is now with TU Wien (Austria).,
20298,"To create and trace this state, the researchers used unique detection and perturbation methods especially developed for this purpose.",
20299,They observed that not only did the motional degree of freedom become superfluid but the spin as well.,
20300,Magnetic quantum fluids can thereby become extremely fluid in two ways.,
20301,"“Our new research methods allow us not only to characterise the condensate but will also allow us to better understand the path from non-equilibrium to that state,” explains Markus Oberthaler, head of the “Synthetic Quantum Systems” research group, which is also part of the STRUCTURES Cluster of Excellence of Heidelberg University.",
20302,The experimental physicists collaborated with the research group of Prof. Dr Jürgen Berges at the Institute for Theoretical Physics to calculate the theoretical predictions for the experimental observables.,
20303,"To achieve agreement between the calculations and the results of the experiment, an extremely cold temperature had to be assumed.",
20304,"“That surprised us all and will be the topic of further investigations for independent verification,” state the authors of the “Nature Physics” paper.

20311,"The award is also evidence of the strength of the Health + Life Science Alliance Heidelberg Mannheim, which – as exemplified in Stefan Pfister’s research – combines medical skills with novel molecular biological methods.”",
20312,"In its statement of reasons for awarding the prize, the DFG particularly highlights Prof. Pfister’s analyses of brain tumour tissue, which build on novel genome-based approaches and, inter alia, take into account changes in the expression of genes and their epigenetic regulation.",
20313,"Prof. Pfister’s research enabled a new molecular-pathological classification of childhood brain tumours, which has been recognised and adopted by the World Health Organization.",
20314,"Today, this scientific basis forms the foundation worldwide for a more accurate diagnosing of diseases that have over 100 different molecular causes, as the Heidelberg scientist has shown.",
20315,The German Research Foundation regards Stefan Pfister’s investigations as “a breakthrough in paediatric oncology and an impressive example of precision medicine”.,
20316,Stefan Pfister studied human medicine at the Universities of Hamburg and Tübingen.,
20317,After earning his doctorate in Tübingen he became a post-doctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston / Massachusetts (USA).,
20318,"He trained in paediatrics at Mannheim University Hospital, the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Heidelberg University Hospital.",
20319,His habilitation in 2010 at Heidelberg University entitled him to teach paediatrics as a subject.,

20327,Ribosomes are the nanomachines of the cell whose task is the correct synthesis of proteins.,
20328,"Researchers at the Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center are studying the emergence of these “protein factories”, also known as ribosomes.",
20329,"Led by Prof. Dr Ed Hurt, they have decoded the special role of a heretofore unexplored biogenesis factor in the maturation of precursor ribosomes.",
20330,"The research results, obtained in close cooperation with colleagues of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, were published in the journal “Cell Reports”.",
20331,Every cell has a number of these nanomachines that act as protein factories manufacturing vital proteins with various tasks for the organism.,
20332,A functional ribosome consists of two subunits that are assembled during formation by helper proteins – so-called biogenesis factors.,
20333,The ribonucleic acids (RNA) and proteins are united into precursors and later complete ribosomes.,
20334,This process begins in the cell nucleus with the manufacture of a long RNA chain.,
20335,"Step by step, the chain is biochemically altered at selected RNA modules, whereby short RNA molecules known as snoRNAs – small nucleolar RNAs – guide the required enzymes to the selected RNA bases.",
20336,The precursor RNA chain is then trimmed and finally embellished with ribosomal proteins.,
20337,"“Until now it was unclear when the individual modules are modified and how these modifications are coupled with other maturation steps,” explains Ed Hurt, Senior Professor at the Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center (BZH).",
20338,"Working with researchers at the Gene Center of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the Heidelberg scientists were able to demonstrate how a previously unstudied biogenesis factor called Cms1 temporally coordinates the maturation of precursor ribosomes.",
20339,"A highly specific, local chemical change in the ribosomal RNA takes place in the earliest stages of ribosome production.",
20340,"“At this point in time, the RNA is not yet folded and compressed and is therefore accessible for modification by enzymes, which is not possible later in the mature and compact ribosome,” explains Prof. Hurt.",
20341,"In this process, there is an interaction between biogenesis factor Cms1 and a specific area of the still immature RNA.",
20342,"“The central function of Cms1 is to prevent the bonding of other biogenesis factors until the RNA is chemically altered at specific sites,” says Dr Benjamin Lau, a research assistant on Prof. Hurt’s team.",
20343,"With their findings on the mechanisms leading to functional ribosomes, the researchers also hope to gain a better understanding of diseases such as ribosomopathies, which are based on defective maturation processes.",
20344,"According to Prof. Hurt, there are also clear indications that ribosomal RNA modifications could play a role in the development of cancer.",
20345,"Cancer cells depend on the accelerated production of ribosomes, explains the Heidelberg researcher.
",
20346,Not being discouraged by setbacks but trying new approaches and even starting all over again – that is the principle and creed of all research and the often rocky road to new findings.,
20347,Roman philosopher Seneca already described how every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.,
20348,"The thematic pair BEGINNING & END is the focus of the new edition of RUPERTO CAROLA, the research magazine published by Heidelberg University.",
20349,"Across the university’s 13 faculties, the articles on this focal theme illustrate not only what issues can lie at the beginning of a research project and what multifarious results can emerge at its end; the breadth of topics ranges from the beginning of “life” in its various facets to its end.",
20350,"The contributions of the 25 Heidelberg academics deal with reproductive medicine and palliative care, disappearing glaciers, languages on the verge of extinction or the response of life in the continuing transformation of nature.",
20351,"The 21st issue of the RUPERTO CAROLA research magazine takes up apocalyptic thinking and planning for the time after the disaster; it offers insights into the excavations from the destroyed city of Nineveh, one of the largest metropolises of antiquity, and presents new findings on the life and death of galaxies, based on observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.",
20352,"“What we perceive as a beginning or an end depends on our interpretation – it is not objective fact,” is one of the insights from the expert conversation in which historian Prof. Dr Stefanie Gänger and astrophysicist Prof. Dr Matthias Bartelmann compare notes about linear and cyclical concepts of time, narratives of decline and differing perceptions of crisis.",
20353,"The RUPERTO CAROLA research magazine appears twice a year, mainly in German with English abstracts, and addresses all members of the university, its partners in academia, politics, business and society, and, in particular, alumni, friends and an interested public in Germany and abroad.",

20357,"Jointly organised with the University of Stuttgart, RTG 2948 “Mixed Ionic-Electronic Transport: From Fundamentals to Application” – a programme to promote early career researchers – will be financed by the German Research Foundation with approximately 7.4 million euros over a period of five years.",
20358,"The RTG, with research groups from chemistry, physics and engineering sciences, will explore how ions and electrons interact in organic, hybrid and nanostructured materials and how this interplay can be used for creating new functionalities, for example, in bioelectronics.",
20359,Spokesperson is Prof. Dr Jana Zaumseil (Heidelberg); co-spokesperson is Prof. Dr Sabine Ludwigs (Stuttgart).,
20360,Mixed ionic-electronic semiconductors are materials in which both ions and electrons can move when an electric field is applied.,
20361,"Their properties, for example mechanical or optical, depend strongly on the concentration of ionic and electronic charges and their interactions.",
20362,"For instance, actuators for soft robotics can be produced from polymers with mixed ionic-electronic conduction that change volume and shape depending on the electrical stimulus.",
20363,"Such mixed semiconductors can even mimic the function of synapses for artificial neuromorphic systems, Prof. Zaumseil explains.",
20364,"“For all these applications, a fundamental understanding of the interplay between ions and electrons in these materials is required to be able to tailor their properties.",
20365,"This is the goal of our Research Training Group,” says Prof. Zaumseil, who is based at the Institute for Physical Chemistry of Heidelberg University.",
20366,"Starting in October this year, two consecutive cohorts of up to twenty doctoral researchers at Heidelberg University and the University of Stuttgart will explore and develop novel mixed ionic-electronic conductors, semiconductors and devices.",
20367,The experimental work will be accompanied by modelling and simulation from the molecular level to the macroscale.,
20368,"“The combination of fundamental and applied research, close collaboration across disciplines, exchanges with our international partners, and a tailored qualification programme will provide our doctoral researchers with ideal conditions for future careers in this rapidly developing area of research and technology,” emphasises Prof. Ludwigs, who works at the Institute of Polymer Chemistry of the University of Stuttgart.

20369,"Using the observations of a distant, very luminous galaxy, an international research team has discovered a cluster of galaxies with the aid of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and, at the same time, one of the densest known areas of galaxy formation in the early Universe.",
20370,The observations from the new space telescope revealed a galaxy protocluster forming in the region around a quasar.,
20371,This emerging galaxy cluster could give information about how galaxies in the early Universe evolved into the cosmic network visible today.,
20372,"Dr Dominika Wylezalek, a scientist at the Centre for Astronomy of Heidelberg University (ZAH), was in charge of the research work.",
20373,"The focus of the investigations was a galaxy with a very active, luminous core, which is fed by a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy.",
20374,"It is assumed that such a core, known as a quasar, can launch a “galactic wind” that pushes the gas out of the host galaxy.",
20375,These outflows of matter could thereby influence the formation of other stars and galaxies.,
20376,The international research team led by Dr Wylezalek observed the quasar SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 – J1652 for short – with the James Webb Space Telescope.,
20377,"The quasar existed back in the very early Universe, that is, about 11.5 billion years ago.",
20378,Its striking red light was shifted into the infra-red due to its large distance and the expansion of the Universe.,
20379,"Hence quasar J1652 is particularly suited to observations with the James Webb telescope, which was designed especially for observations in this spectral range.",
20380,Previous investigations showed that fast gas outflows are driven by the quasar and found evidence for the merging of the quasar with a neighbouring galaxy.,
20381,"Surprisingly, the observations with the JWST confirm that not only one galaxy but at least three more are swirling around at high speed and are tightly packed.",
20382,Scientists also call such a system a galaxy protocluster – a cluster of galaxies in formation.,
20383,The objects in the direct environment of the quasar were analysed with infrared spectroscopy.,
20384,"According to Dr Wylezalek, they indicate that J1652 is part of a dense knot of galaxy formation.",
20385,This conclusion is only possible due to the outstanding imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope.,
20386,“There are few galaxy protoclusters known at this early time.,
20387,They are hard to find and very few have had time to form since the Big Bang.,
20388,"Our discovery may help us understand how galaxies in dense environments evolve,” says the astrophysicist.",
20389,“We are looking into the earliest phases of the evolution of these galaxies.”,
20390,The international researcher team suggests that they have discovered one of the densest known areas of galaxy formation in the early Universe – taking account of the speed at which the three confirmed galaxies are orbiting each other and how closely they are packed into the region around the quasar.,
20391,“Even a dense knot of dark matter is not sufficient to explain the properties wehave observed.,
20392,"We think we could be seeing a region in which two knots of dark matter are merging together,” says the scientist, who heads an Emmy Noether junior research group at Heidelberg University’s Institute for Astronomical Computing, which belongs to the ZAH.",
20393,"From follow-up observations she hopes to understand how dense, chaotic galaxy clusters like this one form and how they evolved to become the cosmic network visible today.",
20394,"With her team, to which postdoctoral researcher Dr Caroline Bertemes also belongs, Dr Wylezalek first wants to discover how the protocluster is affected by galactic winds and quasar feedback generated by the active, supermassive black hole at its heart.",
20395,"Besides the Heidelberg team, other scientists from Germany, France, the UK, Mexico and the United States were involved in the research.",
20396,The observations with the James Webb Space Telescope took place as part of the Early Release Science Programme within the first five months after the start of JWST scientific operations.,

20406,"Above all, however, I am grateful for the great trust that the members of the Senate and the University Council have shown me and I look forward to good cooperation as we continue to develop our alma mater.”",
20407,Frauke Melchior studied chemistry at the University of Marburg and the University of Bristol (United Kingdom) and in 1990 earned her doctorate in Marburg on a biochemical topic.,
20408,As a postdoctoral researcher in the field of molecular cell biology she first worked at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen and from 1992 at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla (USA).,
20409,There she studied protein sorting in human cells and discovered what is called the SUMO protein – denoting a mechanism of post-translational protein modification which became a focus of her scientific work.,
20410,"In 1998 the scientist started the first research group of her own at another Max Planck Institute, the MPI of Biochemistry in Martinsried near Munich.",
20411,Six years later she accepted a professorship for biochemistry in the field of human medicine at the University of Göttingen.,

20418,Prof. Eitel: “It will certainly be a special challenge to develop the future priorities in the excellence strategy in cooperation with your colleagues and to establish them widely in the university.”,

20421," The history of the University of Innsbruck starts about 100 years before its official foundation in 1669, when in 1562 a Jesuit school/college was established.",
20422,"Emperor Leopold I used this school as a foundation to establish a university on 15 October, 1669.",
20423,"He guaranteed its financing by introducing a new extraordinary tax on salt extracted in Hall, the so called Haller Salt Surcharge.",
20424,"Eight years later in 1677, the founding certificate was issued, which mentioned four faculties.",
20425,"In the following years, the University had to endure challenging times – it was dissolved and reopened twice.",
20426,"In 1826, Francis I Emperor of Austria finally founded the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Law and, thereafter, other faculties were established step-by-step.",
20427,"In 1969 teaching started at the Faculty of Civil Engineering Sciences and Architecture, and in 1976 the Faculty of Sociology and Economics was established, which used to be integrated into the Faculty of Law and Political Science.",
20428,Under the University Act 2002 the University was re-organized into 15 faculties and the Faculty of Medicine became a University in its own right – the Medical University of Innsbruck.,
20429,In 2012 the Faculty of Teacher Education has been established and became the 16th faculty of the University of Innsbruck.,
20430,On the occasion of its 350th anniversary the University of Innsbruck is addressing its varied and multifaceted past.,

20436,The Nobel Prize winner of 2022 was honored for his outstanding scientific achievements.,
20437,"Zeilinger was a professor at the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck from 1990 to 1999, where he carried out much of the work recently honored with the Nobel Prize.",
20438,"With his groundbreaking research in Innsbruck in the 1990s, Anton Zeilinger laid one of the cornerstones for the rise of Innsbruck\s quantum physics to world leadership.",
20439,The University of Innsbruck honored his achievements today by awarding him an honorary doctorate of science.,
20440,"With this honorary doctorate, we are honoring a truly outstanding personality in Austrian science, emphasized Rector Tilmann Märk at the ceremony in the university\s auditorium.",
20441,"After his appointment in 1990, Anton Zeilinger found the space and freedom in Innsbruck to pursue his innovative ideas and to implement them in groundbreaking experiments.",
20442,It fills us with great joy and pride that these achievements were recently honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics and that Anton Zeilinger now remains closely associated with the University of Innsbruck as an honorary doctor.,
20443,"However, Zeilinger was and is not only an outstanding scientist.",
20444,"He also knows how to make complex matters such as quantum physics, accessible and interesting for lay people.",
20445,"In this way, Anton Zeilinger has made a very significant contribution to popularizing quantum physics in our country, said Rector Märk.",
20446,"After numerous stays abroad in the 1970s and 1980s, Anton Zeilinger was appointed to the University of Innsbruck in 1990.",
20447,Here he worked as a university professor for experimental physics and head of the department until 1999.,
20448,"He and his team moved into modern laboratories in the Victor Franz Hess Building, newly built at the end of the 1980s on the Technik Campus in the west of Innsbruck.",
20449,"Around 1995, Anton Zeilinger and his group developed a new, high-intensity source of entangled photon pairs, which was the starting point for many new experiments on quantum entanglement.",
20450,"With this, he succeeded in the first teleportation with light particles in 1997.",
20451,This result was the basis for many further applications in the field of quantum communication and for new quantum experiments.,
20452,"After moving to Vienna, Anton Zeilinger and his Innsbruck colleagues around Rainer Blatt and Peter Zoller strived to establish quantum physics on a broad basis in Austria.",
20453,A joint FWF special research area and the founding of the Academy Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) in Innsbruck and Vienna finally formed the foundation for todays world-renowned cutting-edge research in this field.,
20454,"Today, more than 20 internationally renowned research groups at the University of Innsbruck conduct research in the field of quantum physics and regularly attract attention with new research results.",
20455,"]
",
20456,"Using all of images from the video reel, the team could then estimate the quantum states of the atom.",
20457,"When it comes to creating ever more intriguing quantum systems, a constant need is finding new ways to observe them in a wide range of physical scenarios.",
20458,"JILA Fellow Cindy Regal and JILA and NIST Fellow Ana Maria Rey have teamed up with Oriol Romero-Isart from the University of Innsbruck and IQOQI to show that a trapped particle in the form of an atom readily reveals its full quantum state with quite simple ingredients, opening up opportunities for studies of the quantum state of ever larger particles.",
20459,"In the quantum realm an atom does not behave as point particle, instead it behaves more as a wave.",
20460,"Its properties (e.g., its position and velocity) are described in terms of what is referred to as the wavefunction of the atom.",
20461,One way to learn about the wavefunction of a particle is to let the atom fly and then capture its location with a camera.,
20462,"And with the right tricks, pictures can be taken of the particle’s quantum state from many vantage points, resulting in what is known as quantum tomography (‘tomo’ being Greek for slice or section, and ‘graphy’ meaning describing or recording).In the work published in Nature Physics, the authors used a rubidium atom placed carefully in a specific state of its motion in a tightly focused laser beam, known as an optical tweezer.",
20463,And they were able to observe it from many vantage points by letting it evolve in the optical tweezer in time.,
20464,"Like a ball rolling in a bowl, at different times the velocity and location of the particle interchange, and by snapping pictures at the right time during a video reel of the ball, many vantages of the particle’s state can be revealed.",
20465,The researchers used multiple time-of-flight camera pictures as a tomography tool and reconstructed the quantum state of their trapped atom without any other aids.,
20466,"The quantum tomography revealed features one would not find for an atom in a classical state, but that required instead a genuine quantum description for understanding the combined measured patterns.",
20467,"Atoms that are trapped and behaving quantum mechanically are nothing new to JILA, and time-of-flight is a way in which experimenters often learn about the momentum spread of a collection of atoms.",
20468,"One reason the researchers started thinking about this experiment with a single atom was actually a result of protocols proposed for large trapped particles, where many atoms in a solid are stuck together, moving as one.",
20469,"“Nanoparticles are solid objects containing billions of atoms and can be used to test quantum mechanics at large scales,” Oriol Romero-Isart explained.",
20470,"“Some of the ideas and protocols we have theoretically devised in this context can be tested with single atoms, using the exquisite control that the team of Cindy Regal has with single atoms in their lab.”",
20471,Romero-Isart proposed in a 2011 paper that time of flight combined with letting a single particle roll coherently in a trap could result in full quantum tomography.,
20472,"And, in contrast to many techniques that are often used for quantum tomography, it would be applicable to any particle, as long as it could be seen on a camera.",
20473,"“Quantum tomography has been accomplished in many different ways for a variety of particles and systems,” explained Regal.",
20474,"The technique used by the researchers, however, is intriguingly simple because you just wait for the right time during the video reel, and let the atom fly.",
20475,"“Quantum tomography is a protocol that aims to determine the full quantum state of a system,” explained JILA and NIST Fellow Ana Maria Rey.",
20476,"As Romero-Isart, added: “Since in quantum mechanics a single measurement perturbs the state of the system, quantum tomography requires the ability to repeat the experiment under identical conditions.”",
20477,"Regal, Rey, and Romero-Isart set out to see if an optical tweezer trap was a controlled enough platform to see a provable quantum behavior for a single particle, the single particle being an atom for these experiments, using Romero-Isart’s proposed video reel technique Using the optical tweezers, Cindy Regal and her team were able to record the atoms time of flight after releasing the atom from the trap.",
20478,"“For this experiment, we looked at rubidium atoms,” Regal added.",
20479,"“What we do is create many single identical atoms, around 60,000 times, each time creating the atom nominally in the same state.”In",
20480,"repeating this over and over, the researchers could create a type of image that reveals the velocity, or momentum, of the atom at the time when it was released from the trap.",
20481,"“Imagine, for example, a particle that has very low momentum,” Rey posited, “If we release it, then the particle will barely move and we will find it very close to its initial position after time evolution.",
20482,"On the other hand, a very energetic particle will move very fast after we release it from the trap, and we will find it very far away.",
20483,"So, the map of the positions of the particles after a long time of evolution allows us to determine the momentum at the time of release.”, The camera used to take these images was different from what Regal used in the past to help create these informative images.",
20484,"“Because we had to take images of the atoms quickly during their flight, it is important to capture as many photons from the atom as possible and optimize the camera for low noise,” said Regal.",
20485,"A new video reel is then taken by repeating the experiment sequence again, but capturing the system at a different point in time in the optical tweezer video reel.",
20486,"Using all of images from the video reel, the team could then estimate the quantum states of the atom.",
20487,"“One key contribution of the theory was to be able to reconstruct what is called the Wigner function of the state (which connects the wave function of a quantum state to a probability distribution in position-momentum space) from experimental measurements,” explained Rey.",
20488,"“One key outcome of the work was to prepare the atom in a state that is fully quantum and cannot admit a classical description,” Rey added.",
20489,"“We were able to demonstrate that even accounting for small imperfections and systematic errors unavoidable in the experiment, the state retains a negative Wigner function which can only happen for genuine quantum states.”",
20490,The capability to prepare and measure a single atom wavefunction featuring a negative Wigner function revealed the success of the quantum protocol implemented by the researchers.,
20491,"The measurement idea will be useful for benchmarking the performance of quantum state control in optical tweezers, which is increasingly important for quantum computing and metrology in neutral atom arrays.",
20492,"As much of quantum physics revolves around isolating and manipulating atomic states, the results of this experiment offer promising new avenues for further explorations.",
20493,"“There are exciting directions ahead,” Rey said.",
20494,"Regal, Rey, and Romero-Isart will continue their collaboration by not only drawing parallels between how one images quantum states of neutral particles, but also in creating arbitrary motional quantum states, and expanding concepts to more traps and more atoms.",
20495,"These explorations will further push the boundaries of quantum control afforded by optical tweezers.

20497,Computer scientist Adam Jatowt was awarded the Best Paper Award at the European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) this year in Dublin for the article Temporal Natural Language Inference: Evidence-Based Evaluation of Temporal Text Validity.,
20498,The European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the most important European research conference for the presentation of new results in the field of Information Retrieval (IR).,
20499,"Out of a total of 489 submissions, 175 papers were accepted this year, and Adam Jatowt, with his co-authors Taishi Hosokawa and Kazunari Sugiyama, received the conference\s Best Paper Award for the paper Temporal Natural Language Inference: Evidence-Based Evaluation of Temporal Text Validity.",
20500,"It is important to understand whether textual information remains valid or not - this applies to various applications, such as understanding stories, information retrieval, and tracking state and information status in microblogs and chatbot conversations.",
20501,"It is also beneficial to understand stories more deeply, explains the computer scientist.",
20502,"For computers, however, this kind of understanding is difficult because it requires temporal imagination.",
20503,"In the now awarded paper, the authors therefore propose a novel task, Temporal Natural Language Inference, which uses traditional natural language understanding to determine the temporal validity of textual content.",
20504,"The task requires inferring and judging whether an action expressed in a sentence is still in progress or already completed, i.e., whether the sentence is still valid given its additional content.",
20505,"We first create our own dataset for this task and train different machine learning models, says Jatowt.",
20506,The computer scientists then propose an effective method for learning information from an external knowledge base that provides evidence of temporal commonsense knowledge.,
20507,"Using a prepared dataset, the paper presents a new machine learning model that incorporates the information from the knowledge base and shows that the new model performs better on the proposed task than the other state-of-the-art approaches.

20510,The quantum nature of objects visible to the naked eye is currently a much-discussed research question.,
20511,A team led by Innsbruck physicist Gerhard Kirchmair has now demonstrated a new method in the laboratory that could make the quantum properties of macroscopic objects more accessible than before.,
20512,"With the method, the researchers were able to increase the efficiency of an established cooling method by an order of a magnitude.",
20513,"With optomechanical experiments, scientists are trying to explore the limits of the quantum world and to create a foundation for the development of highly sensitive quantum sensors.",
20514,"In these experiments, objects visible to the naked eye are coupled to superconducting circuits via electromagnetic fields.",
20515,"To get functioning superconductors, such experiments take place in cryostats at a temperature of about 100 millikelvin.",
20516,But this is still far from sufficient to really dive into the quantum world.,
20517,"In order to observe quantum effects on macroscopic objects, they must be cooled to nearly absolute zero using sophisticated cooling methods.",
20518,Physicists led by Gerhard Kirchmair from the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck and the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) have now demonstrated a nonlinear cooling mechanism with which even massive objects can be cooled well.,
20519,"In the current paper, the Innsbruck researchers couple the mechanical object - in their case a vibrating beam - to the superconducting circuit via a magnetic field.",
20520,"To do this, they attached a magnet to the beam, which is about 100 micrometers long.",
20521,"When the magnet moves, it changes the magnetic flux through the circuit, the heart of which is a so-called SQUID, a superconducting quantum interference device.",
20522,"Its resonant frequency changes depending on the magnetic flux, which is measured using microwave signals.",
20523,"In this way, the micromechanical oscillator can be cooled to near the quantum mechanical ground state.",
20524,"Furthermore, David Zöpfl from Gerhard Kirchmair\s team explains, The change in the resonant frequency of the SQUID circuit as a function of microwave power is not linear.",
20525,"As a consequence, we can cool the massive object by an order of magnitude more for the same power.",
20526,"This new, simple method is particularly interesting for cooling more massive mechanical objects.",
20527,Zöpfl and Kirchmair are confident that this could be the foundation for the search of quantum properties in larger macroscopic objects.,

20531,A fully functioning network node made with two single matter systems enabling entanglement creation with a photon at the standard frequency of the telecommunications network and entanglement swapping operations.,
20532,"A quarter of a century ago, theoretical physicists at the University of Innsbruck made the first proposal on how to transmit quantum information via quantum repeaters over long distances which would open the door to the construction of a worldwide quantum information network.",
20533,"Now, a new generation of Innsbruck researchers has built a quantum repeater node for the standard wavelength of telecommunication networks and transmitted quantum information over tens of kilometers.",
20534,Quantum networks connect quantum processors or quantum sensors with each other.,
20535,This allows tap-proof communication and high-performance distributed sensor networks.,
20536,"Between network nodes, quantum information is exchanged by photons that travel through optical waveguides.",
20537,"Over long distances, however, the likelihood of photons being lost increases dramatically.",
20538,"As quantum information cannot simply be copied and amplified, 25 years ago Hans Briegel, Wolfgang Dür, Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller, then all at the University of Innsbruck, provided the blueprints for a quantum repeater.",
20539,These feature light-matter entanglement sources and memories to create entanglement in independent network links that are connected between them by a so-called entanglement swap to finally distribute entanglement over long distances.,
20540,Quantum physicists led by Ben Lanyon from the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck have now succeeded in building the core parts of a quantum repeater — a fully functioning network node made with two single matter systems enabling entanglement creation with a photon at the standard frequency of the telecommunications network and entanglement swapping operations.,
20541,The repeater node consists of two calcium ions captured in an ion trap within an optical resonator as well as single photon conversion to the telecom wavelength.,
20542,"The scientists thus demonstrated the transfer of quantum information over a 50-kilometer-long optical fiber, with the quantum repeater placed exactly halfway between starting and end point.",
20543,The researchers were also able to calculate which improvements of this design would be necessary to make transmission over 800 kilometers possible which would allow to connect Innsbruck to Vienna.,

20549,A new generation of scientists at the University of Innsbruck and the Medical University Innsbruck continues this successful path.,
20550,"Based on the FWF-funded doctoral program CavX, the researchers are investigating together a wide range of calcium channel properties and functions in health and disease using the most state-of-the-art methods.",
20551,"In electrically excitable cells such as nerves, muscles and endocrine cells, voltage gated calcium channels regulate a variety of vital functions, including synaptic transmission, sensory processes such as hearing and vision, muscle contractions and the release of hormones.",
20552,"Dysfunctions of these cell membrane proteins underlie many pathological conditions such as autism, Parkinsons, diabetes mellitus, retinal dysfunctions, hearing loss, and muscle weakness.",
20553,"The Innsbruck calcium channel research cluster composed of 11 research groups based at both Innsbruck universities has made critical progress in understanding how different calcium channels work, how they regulate cellular functions in health and disease, and what their pharmacological potential is.",
20554,7 of the research groups were recently funded by the FWF doc.funds program and aim to tackle within the International CavX PhD program a whole new array of questions.,
20555,", Each participating research group contributes to the network with its own expertise and methodologies.",
20556,"However, facilitated by their numerous collaborations within the CavX network, each group has access to the collective knowhow and the most state-of-the-art scientific methods and facilities available at both Innsbruck universities.",
20557,"“Most importantly, this research expertise and these methods are made available to the young scientists to develop their own careers.",
20558,This FWF funded PhD program besides promoting collaboration and research is a critical teaching platform.,
20559,"In the first funding period the program trained over 30 doctoral students, and we aim to increase this number in the following years.”",

20590,Detailed knowledge about whales in European waters will be provided by the Biodiversa+ project eWHALE.,
20591,"Detailed knowledge about whales in European waters will be provided by the Biodiversa+ project eWHALE, which started in January and is led by molecular ecologist Bettina Thalinger from the University of Innsbruck.",
20592,"The transnational research project brings together partners from science, industry and the public to establish a far-reaching, non-invasive cetacean and biodiversity monitoring system using water samples.",
20593,"To effectively protect whales and other endangered marine species, it is necessary to emphasize conservation measures for entire marine areas.",
20594,This is one of the aims of the European Union\s Biodiversity Strategy 2030.,
20595,"However, particularly relevant areas for the recovery and conservation of biodiversity, can only be identified if sufficient data are available: Researchers from Austria, Portugal, France, Italy, Ireland, Norway and Iceland together with business partners and interested citizens will contribute to this endeavor in the project eWHALE.",
20596,"Bettina Thalinger, PhD, from the Institute of Zoology at the University of Innsbruck is leading the research project, which will run from January 2023 to the end of 2025 and is funded under the Biodiversa+ initiative, to provide new knowledge about marine biodiversity.",
20597,"For some cetacean species, individuals cannot be distinguished from one another based on external characteristics.",
20598,"Tissue samples from whales are difficult to obtain and are therefore, not ideal for extensive monitoring, says Bettina Thalinger, explaining important reasons for gaps in the data available on European whale populations.",
20599,"A very promising method to identify species, family groups, their diet, and possibly even single individuals is the analysis of the eDNA (environmental DNA) contained in water samples via molecular methods.",
20600,"Besides the eDNA expertise of the Applied Animal Ecology Research Unit at the University of Innsbruck, the French (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment), Norwegian (Institute of Marine Research) and Irish (University College Cork) partners also bring years of experience working with eDNA to the table.",
20601,"The consortium is completed by partner institutions in Portugal (Universidade dos Açores), Iceland (University of Iceland) and Italy (Politecnico di Milano) which not only focus on whale research, but also include the citizen science aspect in many of their projects.",
20602,A significant aspect of eWHALE is the involvement of people who have booked a whale-watching tour.,
20603,Sampling is easy and will be done during the whale watching tours.,
20604,"Together with the participating tour providers, we want to bring in the citizen science aspect, Thalinger explains.",
20605,These are combined with eDNA samples collected during routine research cruises carried out by Norway and France (National Institute for Ocean Science).,
20606,"In this way, a high number of samples will be taken over a large spatial distance from the Azores up to Iceland and more awareness will be created for the protection of marine habitats.",
20607,"The eWHALE project is a wonderful extension of the educational aspect, which is an important part of our tours and programs.",
20608,"It brings participants into direct contact with new technologies, emphasizes Enrico Villa from CW Azores on behalf of the whale watching providers involved.",
20609,The first sampling on the boats will start this spring with consecutive laboratory analyses scheduled to start in autumn.,
20610,"We will then use the initial results to develop a monitoring strategy for 2024, says Thalinger, explaining the next milestones.",
20611,Our dream is to eventually be able to track individuals via their eDNA.,
20612,"With its Biodiversity Strategy 2030, the European Union aims to ensure the protection and recovery of Europe’s biodiversity.",
20613,"Among other things, this is to be achieved by converting at least 30 percent of Europe\s terrestrial and marine areas into effectively managed protected areas by 2030.",
20614,"“By analyzing the water samples, we not only gain information about whales, but also about other relevant and endangered species, Bettina Thalinger emphasizes.",
20615,"Hence, results generated in eWHALE add to the decision-making basis for the implementation of the biodiversity strategy.",

",
20627,"The nodes of this network were housed in two labs at the Campus Technik to the west of Innsbruck, Austria.",
20628,Trapped ions have previously only been entangled in one and the same laboratory.,
20629,"Now, teams led by Tracy Northup and Ben Lanyon from the University of Innsbruck have entangled two ions over a distance of 230 meters.",
20630,The experiment shows that trapped ions are a promising platform for future quantum networks that span cities and eventually continents.,
20631,Trapped ions are one of the leading systems to build quantum computers and other quantum technologies.,
20632,"To link multiple such quantum systems, interfaces are needed through which the quantum information can be transmitted.",
20633,"In recent years, researchers led by Tracy Northup and Ben Lanyon at the University of Innsbruck’s Department of Experimental Physics have developed a method for doing this by trapping atoms in optical cavities such that quantum information can be efficiently transferred to light particles.",
20634,The light particles can then be sent through optical fibers to connect atoms at different locations.,
20635,"Now, their teams, together with theorists led by Nicolas Sangouard of the Université Paris-Saclay, have for the first time entangled two trapped ions more than a few meters apart.",
20636,"The two quantum systems were set up in in two laboratories, one in the building that houses the Department of Experimental Physics and one in the building that houses the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",
20637,"“Until now, trapped ions were only entangled with each other over a few meters in the same laboratory.",
20638,"Those results were also achieved using shared control systems and photons (light particles) with wavelengths that aren’t suitable for travelling over much longer distances,” Ben Lanyon explains.",
20639,"After years of research and development, the Innsbruck physicists have now managed to entangle two ions across campus.",
20640,"“To do this, we sent individual photons entangled with the ions over a 500-meter fiber optic cable and superimposed them on each other, swapping the entanglement to the two remote ions,” says Tracy Northup, describing the experiment.",
20641,"“Our results show that trapped ions are a promising platform for realizing future distributed networks of quantum computers, quantum sensors and atomic clocks.”
",
20642,The project partners met in Innsbruck at the beginning of the week.,
20643,"The Millenion project focuses on modular scalability and accessibility aspects of trapped-ion quantum computers, tackling the transition from current laboratory-based experiments to industry-grade quantum computing technologies.",
20644,14 academic and industrial leaders across Europe are joining forces to deliver a modular and scalable quantum computing suite with high performance cluster integration and a fault-tolerant register of up to 1000 qubits.,
20645,Millenion will tackle the pressing challenges that quantum computers face on their path from the laboratory to industry scale.,
20646,The successor to the EU Quantum-Flagship project AQTION the Millenion collaboration combines academic and industrial leaders across Europe.,
20647,"Leading science teams setting up the quantum computers based on trapped ions are joining forces with commercial leaders in the field of laser technology, optical design, cryogenic technology, control electronics and computer architectures, to realise the first scalable quantum computer that is capable of controlling 1000 qubits.",
20648,"The envisaged platform, which builds on top of the rack-mounted 50-qubit QC demonstrator realised in the flagship project AQTION, will offer a quantum advantage for various use-cases.",
20649,"“Our consortium will aggressively pursue disruptive development goals”, says Project Coordinator Dr. Thomas Monz, Senior Scientist at the University of Innsbruck and CEO of Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT).",
20650,“Changing from one-dimensional strings of ions to two-dimensional arrays will allow us to support up to 100 qubits and consistently encoding quantum information in the electronic ground state of ion qubits enables error rates smaller than 10-3 per gate operation compatible with fault-tolerant error correction.,
20651,"In addition, implementing parallel gate operations will enable larger algorithmic depth.”",
20652,"The new demonstrator devices will be equipped with a hardware-optimised firmware suite and will be integrated in a high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure to realise a QC/HPC solution, supporting standardised interfaces to various quantum software development kits with cloud accessibility.",
20653,"“Finally, we will pave the way to scalable quantum computing by introducing long-range connectivity between quantum processors”, is Thomas Monz confident.",
20654,These quantum information techniques will be combined with trap fabrication and packaging technologies which integrate optical and electronic components to achieve stable long-term operation in an industrial environment.,
20655,"“These scientific and technological advances will provide a powerful hardware platform that can be exploited by partnering quantum software companies within this project, the ion-trap quantum computing platform will be extended to push towards 1000 qubits, realize fault-tolerant performance levels, and pursue the demonstration of a European quantum advantage”, says Thomas Monz as the project partners meet in Innsbruck, Austria, for the launch of the new project.

20656,"The Innsbruck geology team has been carrying out investigations in Devils Hole for years, here descending into the cave to take drill cores under water.",
20657,"An international team including Simon Steidle from the Quaternary Research Group at the Department of Geology at the University of Innsbruck has reconstructed the evolution of groundwater in the Great Basin, USA – one of the driest regions on Earth – up to 350,000 years into the past with unprecedented accuracy.",
20658,The results shed new light on the effects of climate change on water supply and provide important insights for the sustainable use of groundwater resources.,
20659,The study was published in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment.,
20660,The team led by Christoph Spötl has been investigating the famous Devils Hole cave system in Nevada since 2010 - during spectacular expeditions.,
20661,"Using the calcite deposits in the cave, the researchers have already reconstructed the development of the water level in the cave up to several hundred thousand years ago.",
20662,"In the current study, this information has now been combined with a numerical groundwater model for this arid region.",
20663,"Based on our extensive sampling in Devils Hole, we have a large amount of data that provides information on the evolution of the water table.",
20664,"By combining this with groundwater models from the US Geological Survey, we can now draw quantitative conclusions about changes in precipitation for the entire region over the last 350,000 years using the precise data from the cave, explains the geologist Simon Steidle.",
20665,"In drylands like the southwest of the USA, precipitation is particularly important and groundwater data is a mirror of changes in the hydroclimate.",
20666,"The results can be useful for developing water management strategies and sustainable use of groundwater resources, such as how much water can be withdrawn for agricultural purposes.",
20667,"Using an underwater drill specially developed for the expedition to Devils Hole, the researchers took samples from the calcite deposits in the cave.",
20668,The new data suggest that the elevation of the water table in Devils Hole was three to four times more sensitive to groundwater recharge during dry climates than during wetter climates of the past.,
20669,"Given that drought conditions will likely increase even more in the future due to the ongoing climate crisis, our results highlight the vulnerability of large aquifers, and thus the alteration of the most important freshwater resource in this area of the United States, Steidle said.",
20670,"The minimum groundwater level in Devils Hole during the peak of the interglacial warm periods was no more than 1.6 metres below today\s level, which corresponds to a decrease in groundwater recharge of less than 17 % compared to today\s conditions.",
20671,"During the glacial periods, however, the level was at least 9.5 metres above today\s level, which means an increase in groundwater recharge of almost 250% compared to today\s conditions.",
20672,"The new information is relevant especially for the already highly endangered Devils Hole pupfish, a fish measuring just a few centimetres whose only habitat is the water in Devils Hole.",
20673,The habitat of this species is thus the smallest of all known vertebrates (about half the size of an average classroom).,
20674,"Even small changes in water availability triggered by abstraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes or by climate change are of utmost importance for its survival.
",
20675,One of the two studies examined how heat waves affect the health of industrial workers.,
20676,"Therefore, not only was the temperature controlled, but the participants also had to wear uniforms and perform technical tasks for several hours a day.",
20677,Both hot and cold environments trigger a stress response in the human body and can lead to cardiovascular problems.,
20678,Physiologist Justin Lawley from the Department of Sport Science and colleagues have recently investigated both factors in scientific studies.,
20679,"The results, which were published in the Journals Scientific Reports and Experimental Physiology, are especially interesting in light of the current multiple global crises.",
20680,The climate and energy crises are currently among the greatest challenges of our time and are having a direct physical effect on peoples health.,
20681,"For example, the climate crisis is causing more frequent, longer and more intense heat waves, which are responsible for more deaths than natural disasters.",
20682,"Moreover, the energy crisis is causing a rise in energy costs and forcing many households to heat their homes less often or not at all., The physiological responses to a simulated heat wave and cold ambient temperatures have now been investigated by Justin Lawley, together with his research group, the Laboratory of Exercise and Environmental Physiology, and international scientists in two studies – the focus was on the cardiovascular system.",
20683,"In both studies, we replicated real-world environmental temperatures the body might be exposed to and were able to show physiological responses that could help explain known seasonal variations in cardiovascular deaths, explains Lawley.",
20684,"As part of the Horizon 2020 Heat Shield project, Lawley’s group collaborated with colleagues from Slovenia to examine how heat waves affect the health of industrial workers.",
20685,Seven male participants spent nine consecutive regular workdays in a controlled laboratory setting.,
20686,"On the first and last three days, normal summer temperatures for Central European conditions ranged from 25.1 to 25.7 degrees during work and 21.8 to 22.8 degrees during rest periods.",
20687,"Days four through six represented the heat wave; during this period, researchers created ambient temperatures between 35.2 and 35.8 degrees during work periods and 25.5 to 27.1 degrees during rest periods including while sleeping at night.",
20688,"During the entire study, participants completed daily tasks to simulate typical industrial work.",
20689,"We used a protocol in this study that simulates current heat wave conditions in combination with orthostatic stress, which means changing posture, to determine cardiovascular and thermoregulatory stress in industrial workers, Lawley describes.",
20690,The results show that even relatively mild heat waves cause an increase in core and skin temperatures and an increase in skin blood flow.,
20691,"While these physiological reactions help the body from overheating at rest, during standing the body must now defend both internal temperature and maintain blood pressure to prevent fainting, which puts an extra strain on the cardiovascular system.",
20692,"Interestingly, many of these responses persisted after the heat wave was over, suggesting a residual effect of the heat wave.",
20693,"These responses reflect the stress on the cardiovascular system that industrial workers face during heat waves, which can lead to heat illness, fainting and even potentially death due to accidents or serious medical complications in persons with underlying cardiovascular disease, Lawley points out.",
20694,"In another study, Lawley, along with a team of eleven researchers, examined the impact of mild cold exposure on the cardiovascular system, with a specific focus on what mechanisms are responsible for the increase in blood pressure.",
20695,"In addition to researchers from Innsbruck, scientists from Great Britain and Canada were also involved.",
20696,"Since preventing a rise in blood pressure in the cold is important, the study aimed to examine if the rise in vessel resistance (i.e. vasoconstriction) is due to a change in blood flow in the skeletal muscles or simply the skin.",
20697,"In a laboratory at the Department of Sport Science at the University of Innsbruck, the researchers cooled the skin temperature of 34 test subjects from a normal 32 to 34 degrees to about 27 degrees with ten degrees cold air – on one occasion the entire body was cooled, on another only the face was cooled.",
20698,"We observed that when the entire surface of the body is cooled, blood pressure increases mainly due to an increase in vascular resistance of the skin, although there was also a slight reflex increase in resistance of the blood vessels inside the skeletal muscle.",
20699,"However, importantly, when only the face was cooled, we saw a very similar increase in blood pressure that was due to a reflex increase in vascular resistance of the skin throughout the whole body, Lawley describes.",
20700,"Thus, the team was able to show that the mechanism(s) responsible for the rise in blood pressure during cold exposure depends on which parts of the body are cold.",
20701,"These data are important to educate the population about preventing the potential negative consequences of cold exposure because contrary to the perception of many, cold is even more dangerous to the body than heat.",
20702,"It doesn\t take sub-zero temperatures – as you might think – to cause serious reactions in the body, which will become common for many people unable to heat their homes during the energy crisis.",
20703,"While people typically know to wear warm clothing to protect the skin of their body, arms and legs, we were able to show that protecting the face is equally important even in a mild ambient temperature of ten degrees, Lawley continues.",
20704,Both studies show that climatic conditions can have extreme effects on our cardiovascular system.,
20705,"While negative health aspects triggered by heat waves will increase due to the climate crisis, it is particularly surprising that even cold temperatures around 10 degrees can have significant negative effects on our cardiovascular system even in young people who were part of these studies.",
20706,"Future studies extending these findings to our ageing population and those with pre-existing medical conditions will certainly help mitigate the risk of these new environmental challenges.
",
20707,Ecologist Leopold Füreder has been working in the Rotmoostal valley in the Ötztal for many years.,
20708,"Melting glaciers due to global warming caused by the climate crisis have massive consequences for biodiversity in the Alpine region, as an international team of researchers including the Innsbruck ecologist Leopold Füreder has now shown for the first time for a period between 2020 and 2100.",
20709,"According to the study, numerous invertebrate species are threatened with the loss of their habitats.",
20710,"The researchers call for the expansion of protected areas, also in glacier forelands.",
20711,The study has been published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.,
20712,"Using the example of the 15 most important alpine invertebrate species, such as mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies andnon-biting midges, as well as worms such as the alpine flatworm, the research team modelled for the first time the effects of the climate change on freshwater biodiversity in the entire European Alpine region for a period up to 2100.",
20713,"Glacier, landscape and biodiversity mapping data from the Alps were combined for this purpose.",
20714,"Leopold Füreder, head of the River and Conservation Research Group at the Department of Ecology, contributed analyses of the development of these cold-water species, especially from the glacier region of Rotmoostal in the rear Ötztal of Tyrol, to the modelling.",
20715,The researcher has been closely studying the rivers there for 20 years.,
20716,Diamesa:,
20717,The chironomid larva is typical of strongly glaciated streams.,
20718,Rhithrogena:,
20719,The mayfly larva typically lives in glacier-influenced streams.,
20720,"The larvae of aquatic insects and flatworms, as they occur in glacier-fed and springfed streams of springs in the high alpine region, are highly specialised for their cold habitat and play an important role in the food chain.",
20721,"Due to the increase in temperatures, on the one hand the glaciers are melting, on the other hand the water in the streams is also warming.",
20722,"As a result, their refugia are shifting to ever higher altitudes or, in the worst case, disappearing completely - with consequences for the entire alpine ecosystem.",
20723,"The cold-water species have no choice but to flee to even higher altitudes, as long as that is still possible at all, Füreder explains.",
20724,"In the short term, glacier rivers will carry more water due to melting, but in the long term, the amount of water will decrease and the water temperature will increase even more.",
20725,"The ecologist sees the risk of a chain reaction here: We will then have a lack of food in the form of aquatic insect larvae, for example, for fish at lower elevations such as the brown trout, but also for terrestrial animals such as birds, beetles and spiders, which feed on the adult aquatic insects, this means cuts in food availability.",
20726,"The few areas that remain as habitats for the species communities that specialise in the cold habitats should therefore be specially protected, as the authors emphasise.",
20727,"Only about 12 per cent of the refuges that will still exist by the year 2100, according to the modelling, are located in current nature reserves.",
20728,"As the situation will continue to worsen due to rising temperatures, we must assume that the pressure on the remaining glacier areas will also increase.",
20729,"The search for snow-safe ski areas is just as much an issue as the expansion of hydropower, says Leopold Füreder.",
20730,"Glacier protection - and thus protection of biodiversity - therefore also means increasingly declaring the glacier forelands as nature reserves.
",
20731,"In the next few months, a supercomputer with an integrated quantum processor will be set up and launched at the University of Innsbruck.",
20732,"With 9 million euros in funding from the NextGenerationEU recovery plan for Europe, the University of Innsbruck will combine a quantum computer with a supercomputer in the coming months.",
20733,"The novel system will be used in various fields such as computer science, physics, mathematics and beyond and will be open to all scientists in Austria for research and teaching.",
20734,Many areas of science depend on the computer-aided calculation of mathematical problems.,
20735,Powerful supercomputers capable of performing the most complex calculations on thousands of processors in parallel are available for this purpose.,
20736,"The benefits of high-performance computing can be seen, for example, in weather forecasts, which have to be up-to-date every day.",
20737,"If I were to calculate them on a laptop, it would take several weeks.",
20738,"Alexander Ostermann, Head of the Scientific Computing Research Area",
20739,"However, there are problems that are difficult to crack even for supercomputers or require exorbitant amounts of computing power.",
20740,"In drug research, for example, it may be necessary to calculate the energy of a molecule.",
20741,This is precisely where quantum computers can play to their strengths.,
20742,“The development of quantum computers is still in its infancy.,
20743,"Currently, we operate relatively small systems.",

20770,This molecule is found in soft corals and is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry due to its potential medical applications.,
20771,Soft corals are a rich source of bioactive natural products.,
20772,"The genus Xenia produces the so-called Xenia diterpenoids, which are characterized by their structural complexity and diverse biological activities.",
20773,"Due to their promising activities, pharmaceutical companies are also showing increasing interest in them - some Xenia diterpenoids feature anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, for instance.",
20774,"The first representatives of these substances were isolated as early as 1977, however, they have only been studied to a limited extent.",
20775,The biggest challenge is the low availability of natural sources.,
20776,"Many marine organisms, including corals, are largely impossible to cultivate.",
20777,Large-scale extraction of Xenia diterpenoids from corals in nature would represent an enormous impairment of their sensitive ecosystem.,
20778,"Several attempts to produce the complex molecular structures in the laboratory have failed, and to date only a handful syntheses of structurally simplified modifications have been described in the literature.",
20779,"In 2014, the group of Thomas Magauer started their research on the synthesis of Waixenicin A.",
20780,The goal was to develop a flexible synthetic strategy to this natural product and to explore its mode of action as well as potential for drug development.,
20781,Waixenicin A is a unique member of the Xenia diterpenoids and was first isolated from the Hawaiian octocoral Anthelia edmondsoni at Harvard Medical School in 1984.,
20782,Initial testing in 2011 revealed that Waixenicin A is a selective and highly potent inhibitor of the TRPM7 ion channel.,
20783,"Ion channels play an essential role in various biological processes, including neural signaling and the perception of a wide variety of sensations such as heat, taste, and pain.",
20784,"The Waixenicin A team (from left): Immanuel Plangger, Christian Steinborn, Thomas Magauer, and Julian Lichtenegger Magauers group finally succeeded in synthesizing Waixenicin A in the laboratory in April 2023.",
20785,"The synthesis was very challenging due to the special properties of the natural product but was finally accomplished with the help of an efficient synthetic strategy that Magauers group had established during previous work in the area of herbicides., Despite early progress and a significant breakthrough in 2017, the desired bicyclic scaffold was not accessible in the laboratory.",
20786,The presence of several labile functional groups as well as a strained nine-membered ring prevented the successful synthesis for several years.,
20787,"Eventually, a solution based on an earlier study on the synthesis of the herbicide Cornexistin. was developed.",
20788,The use of an intramolecular ring closure enabled efficient assembly of the desired molecular scaffold.,
20789,"Sequential functionalization of a key bicyclic intermediate allowed selective incorporation of the side chain and completed the first synthesis of Waixenicin A. Further diversification of the key intermediate provided access to two additional Xenia diterpenoids: 9-Deacetoxy-14,15-deepoxyxeniculine and Xeniafaraunol A. Particularly intriguing was the conversion to Xeniafaraunol A, which could be performed in only one step.",
20790,"The significance of this step for the biosynthesis and the biological activity is yet unexplored, so exciting research questions are guaranteed.",
20791,The Magauer group is currently optimizing the developed route and is working on the synthesis of a unique substance library.,

20795,Quantum mechanics allows particles to break through the energetic barrier due to their quantum mechanical wave properties.,
20796,Physicists led by Roland Wester of the University of Innsbruck have now for the first time observed a quantum mechanical tunneling reaction in experiments.,
20797,The observation can also be described exactly in theory.,
20798,"With the study published in Nature, the scientists provide an important reference for this fundamental effect in chemistry.",
20799,It is the slowest reaction with charged particles ever observed.,
20800,Tunneling reactions in chemistry are very difficult to predict.,
20801,"The quantum mechanically exact description of chemical reactions with more than three particles is difficult, with more than four particles it is almost impossible.",
20802,Theorists simulate these reactions with classical physics and must neglect quantum effects.,
20803,"But where is the limit of this classical description of chemical reactions, which can only provide approximations?",
20804,Roland Wester from the Department of Ion Physics and Applied Physics at the University of Innsbruck has long wanted to explore this frontier.,
20805,"“It requires an experiment that allows very precise measurements and can still be described quantum-mechanically,” says the experimental physicist.",
20806,"“The idea came to me 15 years ago in a conversation with a colleague at a conference in the U.S.,” Wester recalls.",
20807,He wanted to trace the quantum mechanical tunnel effect in a very simple reaction.,
20808,"Since the tunnel effect makes the reaction very unlikely and thus slow, its experimental observation was extraordinarily difficult.",
20809,"After several attempts, however, Wester’s team has now succeeded in doing just that for the first time, as they report in the current issue of the journal Nature.",
20810,Roland Westers team chose hydrogen – the simplest element in the universe – for their experiment.,
20811,"They introduced deuterium – a hydrogen isotope – into an ion trap, cooled it down and then filled the trap with hydrogen gas.",
20812,"Because of the very low temperatures, the negatively charged deuterium ions lack the energy to react with hydrogen molecules in the conventional way.",
20813,"In very rare cases, however, a reaction does occur when the two collide.",
20814,", This is caused by the tunnel effect: “Quantum mechanics allows particles to break through the energetic barrier due to their quantum mechanical wave properties, and a reaction occurs,” explains the first author of the study, Robert Wild.",
20815,"“In our experiment, we give possible reactions in the trap about 15 minutes and then determine the amount of hydrogen ions formed.",
20816,"From their number, we can deduce how often a reaction has occurred.”",
20817,"In 2018, theoretical physicists had calculated that in this system quantum tunneling occurs in only one in every hundred billion collisions.",
20818,"This corresponds very closely with the results now measured in Innsbruck and, after 15 years of research, for the first time confirms a precise theoretical model for the tunneling effect in a chemical reaction.",
20819,There are other chemical reactions that might exploit the tunnel effect.,
20820,"For the first time, a measurement is now available that is also well understood in scientific theory.",
20821,"Based on this, research can develop simpler theoretical models for chemical reactions and test them on the reaction that has now been successfully demonstrated.",
20822,"The tunnel effect is used, for example, in the scanning tunneling microscope and in flash memories.",
20823,The tunnel effect is also used to explain the alpha decay of atomic nuclei.,
20824,"By including the tunnel effect, some astrochemical syntheses of molecules in interstellar dark clouds can also be explained.",
20825,The experiment of Westers team thus lays the foundation for a better understanding of many chemical reactions.,

20828,Large numbers can only be factorized with a great deal of computational effort.,
20829,"Physicists at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, led by Wolfgang Lechner are now providing a blueprint for a new type of quantum computer to solve the factorization problem, which is a cornerstone of modern cryptography.",
20830,Todays computers are based on microprocessors that execute so-called gates.,
20831,"A gate can, for example, be an AND operation, i.e. an operation that adds two bits.",
20832,"These gates, and thus computers, are irreversible.",
20833,"That is, algorithms cannot simply run backwards.",
20834,"“If you take the multiplication 2*2=4, you cannot simply run this operation in reverse, because 4 could be 2*2, but likewise 1*4 or 4*1,” explains Wolfgang Lechner, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Innsbruck.",
20835,"If this were possible, however, it would be feasible to factorize large numbers, i.e. divide them into their factors, which is an important pillar of cryptography.",
20836,", Martin Lanthaler, Ben Niehoff and Wolfgang Lechner from the Institut für Theoretische Physik at the University of Innsbruck and the quantum spin-off ParityQC have now developed exactly this inversion of algorithms with the help of quantum computers.",
20837,"The starting point is a classical logic circuit, which multiplies two numbers.",
20838,"If two integers are entered as the input value, the circuit returns their product.",
20839,Such a circuit is built from irreversible operations.,
20840,"“However, the logic of the circuit can be encoded within ground states of a quantum system,” explains Martin Lanthaler from Wolfgang Lechners team.",
20841,"“Thus, both multiplication and factorization can be understood as ground-state problems and solved using quantum optimization methods.”",
20842,", „The core of our work is the encoding of the basic building blocks of the multiplier circuit, specifically AND gates, half and full adders with the parity architecture as the ground state problem on an ensemble of interacting spins,” says Martin Lanthaler.",
20843,The coding allows the entire circuit to be built from repeating subsystems that can be arranged on a two-dimensional grid.,
20844,"By stringing several of these subsystems together, larger problem instances can be realized.",
20845,"Instead of the classical brute force method, where all possible factors are tested, quantum methods can speed up the search process: To find the ground state, and thus solve an optimization problem, it is not necessary to search the whole energy landscape, but deeper valleys can be reached by tunneling.",
20846,"The current research work provides a blueprint for a new type of quantum computer to solve the factorization problem, which is a cornerstone of modern cryptography.",
20847,This blueprint is based on the parity architecture developed at the University of Innsbruck and can be implemented on all current quantum computing platforms.,
20848,The results were recently published in Nature Communications Physics.,

20850,Members of the research team in the quantum computer laboratory at the Department of Experimental Physics.,
20851,"According to Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, two complementary properties, for example single components of a magnetic field, cannot be determined with arbitrary precision at the same time.",
20852,An international team of scientists has now tested a new method on about a dozen quantum computers with which multiple parameters can be optimally determined simultaneously using entangled copies of a quantum state.,
20853,", Many quantities in nature are directional - they possess not only a strength but also a direction.",
20854,"If you want to determine such a quantity, you usually have to measure more than one component – that is, strength in a particular direction – and then reconstruct the original quantity.",
20855,"In our classical world, one simply measures the components one after the other, but not so in the quantum world.",
20856,"There, some quantities are intertwined, and the measurement of one quantity also affects the other - these are known as conjugate quantities.",
20857,"For example, when an atom is illuminated by a laser to determine its position, the photons absorbed by the atom change the particles velocity.",
20858,"“Position and velocity of the atom cannot be measured independently of each other,” explains Christian Marciniak from the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck, Austria.,",
20859,"In March of this year, physicists at the University of Innsbruck already presented the first programmable quantum sensor.",
20860,This method allows the optimal measurement of a single parameter on a given quantum machine.,
20861,"If another, conjugate parameter needs to be determined, this method requires the measurements to be performed one after the other.",
20862,Theoretical physicists at the Australian National University in Canberra have now developed a new method with which conjugate quantities can instead be optimally measured in parallel.,
20863,"In an international collaboration, this method was tested on about a dozen quantum computers: an ion trap quantum computer at the University of Innsbruck, a photonic quantum computer at the University of Jena in Germany, a computer with superconducting quantum bits at the Fraunhofer Research Institute for Optics and Precision Engineering in Jena, and several commercial quantum computers with superconducting quantum bits.",
20864,The new method is based on measuring with one or more copies of a quantum state.,
20865,“These copies are entangled with each other during the measurement.,
20866,"In this way, two parameters of a quantum state that do not commute can also be measured simultaneously,” explains Christian Marciniak.",
20867,“We tested this method on our quantum computers for one and two copies.”,
20868,"With one copy, some of the quantum computers achieved the optimal precision predicted by the theorists, which is exactly the same as the best classical result.",
20869,"With two copies, the measurement accuracy is still at the expected value for only a few quantum computers, with most performing worse than classical methods due to accumulating errors in the computation.",
20870,"“However, quantum computers with error-corrected qubits will be able to gainfully measure with more and more copies in the future,” the experimentalist is convinced.",
20871,"“Importantly, our measurements have shown that the method works well when there is still a lot of noise in the signal.",
20872,"Thats a key point for its practical application that tends to be overlooked.”, Quantum technologies will enable us to determine many physical parameters even more precisely than before.",
20873,"In applications, this can offer many advantages.",
20874,"As an example, Innsbruck quantum physicist Thomas Monz cites imaging techniques in medicine: “In medical imaging, magnetic fields are used everywhere.",
20875,A method that measures more than one component of these fields simultaneously offers great advantages over classical methods.,
20876,This could shorten examination time or further improve resolution.”,
20877,"However, there are still a few hurdles to overcome before that point can be reached.",
20878,"Through their current work, the researchers from Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Austria are improving the understanding of these measurements and paving the way for future technological applications.",
20879,"The research was financially supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF, the European Union and the Federation of Austrian Industries Tyrol, among others.

20882,The scientists obtained a first phase diagram for a supersolid at finite temperature.,
20883,Supersolids are a relatively new and exciting area of research.,
20884,They exhibit both solid and superfluid properties simultaneously.,
20885,"In 2019, three research groups were able to demonstrate this state for the first time beyond doubt in ultracold quantum gases, among them the research group led by Francesca Ferlaino from the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck and the ÖAW Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) in Innsbruck.",
20886,"In 2021, Francesca Ferlainos team studied in detail the life cycle of supersolid states in a dipolar gas of dysprosium atoms.",
20887,"They observed something unexpected: “Our data suggested that an increase in temperature promotes the formation of supersolid structures,” recounts Claudia Politi of Francesca Ferlainos team.",
20888,"“This surprising behaviour was an important boost to theory, which had previously paid little attention to thermal fluctuations in this context.”",
20889,", The Innsbruck scientists joined the force with the danish theoretical group led by Thomas Pohl to explore the effect of thermal fluctuation.",
20890,They developed and published in Nature Communications a theoretical model that can explain the experimental results and underlines the thesis that heating the quantum liquid can lead to the formation of a quantum crystal.,
20891,"The theoretical model shows that as the temperature rises, these structures can form more easily.",
20892,"“With the new model, we now have a phase diagram for the first time that shows the formation of a supersolid state as a function of temperature,” Francesca Ferlaino is delighted to say.",
20893,"“The surprising behavior, which contradicts our everyday observation, arises from the anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interaction of the strongly magnetic atoms of dysprosium.”",
20894,"The research is an important step towards a better understanding of supersolid states of matter and was funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF, the European Research Council ERC and the European Union, among others.
",
20895,"In the study, the researchers used an optical cavity to get the particles in the Fermi gas to interact with each other over long distances.",
20896,"Scientists from the University of Innsbruck, together with colleagues from the EPFL, have found a new way to create a crystalline structure emerging as a “coherent matter density wave” in an atomic gas.",
20897,The findings help to better understand the intriguing behavior of quantum matter close to absolute zero temperature.,
20898,"“Cold atomic gases were well known in the past for the ability to ‘program’ the interactions between atoms,” says Professor Jean-Philippe Brantut at EPFL.",
20899,“Our experiment doubles this ability!”,
20900,"Working with the group of Professor Helmut Ritsch at the Department of Theoretical Physics of the University of Innsbruck, Austria, they have made a breakthrough that can impact not only quantum research but quantum-based technologies in the future.",
20901,"Scientists have long been interested in understanding how materials self-organize into complex structures, such as crystals.",
20902,"In the often-arcane world of quantum physics, this sort of self-organization of particles is seen in ‘density waves’, where particles arrange themselves into a regular, repeating pattern or ‘order’; like a group of people with different colored shirts on standing in a line but in a pattern where no two people with the same color shirt stand next to each other.",
20903,"“Density waves are observed in a variety of materials, including metals, insulators, and superconductors”, says theoretical physicist Farokh Mivehvar from the University of Innsbruck.",
20904,"“However, studying them is challenging, especially when this order (the alternating pattern of particles in the wave) concurs with other types of order such as superfluidity – a property of that allows particles to flow without resistance.”",
20905,"Its worth noting that superfluidity is not just a theoretical curiosity; it is of immense interest for developing materials with unique properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, which could lead to more efficient energy transfer and storage, or for building quantum computers.",
20906,", To explore this interplay, Brantut and his colleagues created a “unitary Fermi gas”, a thin gas of lithium atoms cooled to extremely low temperatures, where atoms collide with each other very often.",
20907,"The researchers then placed this gas in an optical cavity, a device used to confine light in a small space for an extended period of time.",
20908,"Optical cavities are made of two facing mirrors that reflect incoming light back and forth between them thousands of times, allowing light particles, photons, to build up inside the cavity.",
20909,"In the study, the researchers used the cavity to cause the particles in the Fermi gas to interact with one another at long distances: an atom emits a photon in some point in time that bounces back and forth between the cavity mirrors.",
20910,"It is later reabsorbed by another atom of the gas, regardless of how far it is located from the first atom.",
20911,When enough photons are emitted and reabsorbed – easily tuned in the experiment – the atoms collectively organize into a density-wave pattern due to these photon-induced interactions.,
20912,"“The combination of atoms colliding directly with each other in the Fermi gas, while simultaneously exchanging photons over long distances, is a new type of matter where the interactions are extreme and tunable,” says Brantut.",
20913,“We hope to see that this will improve our understanding of some of the most complex materials encountered in nature.”,

20920,"These problems can be addressed by dedicated quantum computers, known as quantum simulators.",
20921,The development of analogue and digital quantum simulators has made significant progress in recent years.,
20922,"As different platforms become more mature in terms of scalability, stability and programmability, quantum simulation is moving from being a means for physicists to answer particular scientific questions towards a powerful tool to help address real-world problems and provide practical applications for industry.",

20969,The scientists analysed several gigabyte of microbial DNA sequences.,
20970,"At the University of Innsbruck, scientists have discovered over 30,000 viruses by using the high-performance computer cluster “Leo” and sophisticated detective work.",
20971,The viruses hide in the DNA of unicellular organisms.,
20972,"In some cases, up to 10% of microbial DNA consists of built-in viruses.",
20973,"During a large-scale study of complex single-celled microbes, Dr. Christopher Bellas, Marie-Sophie Plakolb and Prof. Ruben Sommaruga from the Department of Ecology at the University of Innsbruck made an unexpected discovery.",
20974,"Built into the genome of the microbes, they found the DNA of over 30,000 previously unknown viruses.",
20975,This hidden DNA may allow the replication of complete and functional viruses in the host cell.,
20976,"We were very surprised by how many viruses we found through this analysis, says Bellas.",
20977,"In some cases, up to 10% of a microbe\s DNA turned out to consist of hidden viruses.",
20978,These viruses do not appear to harm their hosts.,
20979,"On the contrary, some may even protect them.",
20980,Many appear to be similar to so-called virophages.,
20981,"These viruses infect and destroy other, harmful viruses that infect their host cell.",
20982,"The study, financed by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), was published in the renowned journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and was carried out in collaboration with researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research and the University of Groningen.",
20983,"From bacteria to humans, all life forms are continuously infected with viruses.",
20984,"Some are constantly present, but only occasionally trigger symptoms, such as the herpes virus in humans.",
20985,"Others hide even deeper, becoming part of their host’s DNA.",
20986,This study found that many of the Earths abundant single-celled eukaryotic (complex) organisms are packed with viruses.,
20987,"These organisms are found everywhere, and include abundant algae in lakes and oceans, amoebae in soil, as well as human parasites.",
20988,", Why so many viruses are found in the genomes of microbes is not yet clear, says Bellas.",
20989,Our strongest hypothesis is that they protect the cell from infection by dangerous viruses.,
20990,"Many eukaryotic single-celled organisms are infected by giant viruses, a group of viruses that can be as large as bacteria.",
20991,These infections kill the host as they create new copies of the giant virus.,
20992,"However, when a virophage resides in the host cell, it ‘reprograms’ the giant virus to build virophages.",
20993,"As a result, the giant virus can sometimes be fended off and the host cell population is saved from destruction.",
20994,The DNA of the newly discovered viruses is similar to virophage DNA.,
20995,"Therefore, it is probable that the host microbes protect themselves from giant viruses through these built-in viruses.",
20996,"The research project was originally based on a new group of viruses that Bellas and Sommaruga discovered in the water of the Gossenköllesee in Tyrol, Austria, in 2021.",
20997,"Initially, we wanted to find the origin of the new \Polinton-like viruses\ with our study, explains Bellas.",
20998,"However, we did not know which organisms are usually infected by these viruses.",
20999,That\s why we conducted a large-scale study to test all microbes whose DNA sequences are known.,
21000,"The huge data set which the researchers examined only contains DNA sequences, i.e. a sequence of the letters ATGC from which all genes are encoded.",
21001,"Nevertheless, the data set consists of several hundred gigabytes.",
21002,"The sequences of viruses, tiny by comparison, could only be found in this large amount of data thanks to state-of-the-art technology.",
21003,"With the high-performance computer cluster Leo of the University of Innsbruck, the data set could be analysed quickly.",
21004,DNA sequences from microbes were also read using the new Oxford Nanopore technology.,
21005,"With this technology, DNA is passed through tiny pores in a membrane.",
21006,"Each base – A, G, C or T – interrupts an electric current and thus generates a signal from which the DNA sequence can be read.",
21007,"In the end, the researchers found much more than the viruses they were looking for.",
21008,"This unexpected discovery will inspire more research to study the roles that these viruses play.

A team of scientists from France and Austria has discovered a new abiotic pathway for the formation of peptide chains from amino acids - a key chemical step in the origin of life.,
21052,The current study provides strong evidence that this crucial step for the emergence of life can indeed occur even in the very inhospitable conditions of space.,
21053,The origin of life is one of the great questions of mankind.,
21054,"One of the prerequisites for the emergence of life is the abiotic - not by living beings caused chemical - production and polymerization of amino acids, the building blocks of life.",
21055,"“Two scenarios are being discussed for the emergence of life on Earth: On the one hand, the first-time creation of such amino acid chains on Earth, and on the other hand, the influx from space,” explains Tilmann Märk from theDepartment of Ion Physics and Applied Physics. of the University of Innsbruck.",
21056,"“For the latter, such amino acid chains would have to be generated in the very unfavorable and inhospitable conditions in space.”",

21068,"Turbulence plays an essential role in weather and climate, and correctly representing its effects in numerical models is crucial for accurate weather forecasts and climate projections.",
21069,"However, the theory describing the effect of turbulence has not changed since its conception in 1950s, despite the fact that it is not representative for the majority of the Earth’s land surface, especially over mountains and polar regions.",
21070,The Innsbruck meteorologist Ivana Stiperski has now extended the turbulence theory to complex atmospheric conditions.,
21071,The researcher thus paves the way for the first generalized turbulence theory over complex terrain.,
21072,Turbulence is the most important exchange mechanism between the Earth\s surface and the overlying atmosphere.,
21073,"However, this mechanism remains one of the last great puzzles of classical physics and mathematics.",
21074,"Ivana Stiperski, head of the research group Atmospheric Turbulence at the Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences at the University of Innsbruck, has dedicated her work to the study of turbulence over mountains, and since 2020 her team is working on the topic within the framework of an ERC Consolidator Grant.",
21075,"Turbulence affects phenomena as diverse as climate, storm systems, air pollution and glacier melt.",
21076,"Accurate weather forecasts and climate predictions therefore require a precise description of turbulence, and over the complex terrain of mountainous regions this is particularly difficult as very little is known about how complex terrain modifies turbulence, and no major advance has happened over the past 70 years, Stiperski explains.",
21077,"Until now, the understanding of atmospheric turbulence and how it is included in weather and climate models has been based on the so-called similarity theory, more specifically the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory  first postulated in 1954.",
21078,"This decades-old theory of turbulence, however, assumes that the Earth’s surface is flat and horizontally homogeneous (i.e., has uniform characteristics in the horizontal, such as for example",
21079,"infinite grasslands or corn fields), and therefore it is not representative for the majority of the Earth’s land surface.",
21080,This incorrect representation of turbulence adds uncertainty to weather prediction and climate projections.,
21081,Removing rime from “Im Hinteren Eis” turbulence tower and weather station in Ötztal Alps.,
21082,The researcher\s goal is to develop a generalized theory valid for all realistic atmospheric conditions - and a first major step in this direction has now been taken.,
21083,"About 70 percent of the Earth\s surface is characterized by a heterogeneous, mountainous structure, or what we call complex terrain, such as for example here in Tyrol.",
21084,"In our study, we use a unique ensemble of large measurement datasets and machine learning techniques to develop new similarity relations, Ivana Stiperski describes the approach in the study published in the journal Physical Review Letters, and highlighted as the Editor’s Suggestion.",
21085,"In her novel theory, the meteorologist includes a new key variable in the calculations: In our novel approach, we include the so-called anisotropy, i.e. the information on how the energy in turbulence is distributed in different spatial directions.",
21086,"We show that this quantity, which has so far not been examined in light of similarity theory, encodes the information on complexity of the surface and flow conditions that drive turbulence, and therefore makes it possible to extend similarity theory to complex terrain.",
21087,"This is the first time that an approach has been successful in complex terrain, and it brings us closer to a unified theory of complex atmospheric turbulence.",
21088,"The approach allows a more correct representation of turbulence effects in weather, climate and air pollution models.",
21089,"This is particularly important for understanding and predicting weather and climate projections in mountainous and polar regions, since similarity theory routinely fails there.",
21090,"These regions are particularly vulnerable and already experiencing unprecedented warming under the global change, and a therefore a precise description of further developments is vital, emphasizes Ivana Stiperski.",
21091,"Research on atmospheric turbulence has a long tradition in Innsbruck, only recently the 100th anniversary was celebrated with international scientists from this field in Innsbruck.",

21100,"Researchers at ETH Zurich and TII Abu Dhabi, with the support of quantum optics theorists from Innsbruck, Austria, have succeeded in simultaneously cooling the motion of a tiny glass sphere in two dimensions to the quantum ground-state.",
21101,This represents a crucial step towards a 3D ground-state cooling of a massive object and opens up new opportunities for the design of ultra-sensitive sensors.,
21102,Glass nanoparticles trapped by lasers in extreme vacuum are considered a promising platform for exploring the limits of the quantum world.,
21103,"Since the advent of quantum theory, the question at which sizes an object starts being described by the laws of quantum physics rather than the rules of classical physics has remained unanswered.",
21104,"A team formed by Lukas Novotny (Zurich), Markus Aspelmeyer (Vienna), Oriol Romero-Isart (Innsbruck), and Romain Quidant (Zurich) is attempting to answer precisely this question within the ERC-Synergy project Q-Xtreme.",
21105,"A crucial step on the way to this goal is to reduce the energy stored in the motion of the nanoparticle as much as possible, i.e. to cool the particle down to the so-called quantum ground-state.",
21106,The Q-Xtreme team has been working together on ground-state cooling of nanoparticles for a long time.,
21107,"Several experiments in Zurich and Vienna, supported by theoretical calculations by Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero and Oriol Romero-Isart, have led to the first demonstrations of such ground-state cooling of a nanoparticle, either by dampening the particle motion using electronic control (active feedback) or by placing the particle between two mirrors (cavity-based cooling).",
21108,"So far in experiments, the ground state has been achieved only along one of the three directions of particle motion, leaving the motion along the other two directions hot.",
21109,"“Achieving ground-state cooling along more than one direction is key for exploring novel quantum physics,” emphasizes Gonzalez-Ballestero of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information at the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Department of Theoretical Physics at the University of Innsbruck.",
21110,“But so far this achievement remained elusive as it was challenging to make the mirrors between which the particle is positioned interact efficiently with the motion along some of the three directions”,
21111,The so-called “Dark Mode Effect” prevented cooling to the full ground state.,
21112,"Now, the research at the Photonics Laboratory of ETH Zurich has succeeded for the first time in ground-state cooling of a nanoparticle along two directions of motion.",
21113,"A glass sphere, about a thousand times smaller than a grain of sand, is completely isolated from its environment in a high vacuum and held by a strongly focused laser beam while simultaneously being cooled to near absolute zero.",
21114,"Based on theoretical predictions from the Innsbruck team, the Swiss physicists were able to circumvent the dark-state problem.",
21115,"To do so, we designed the frequencies at which the particle oscillates in the two directions differently and carefully adjusted the polarization of the laser light, says Lukas Novotny of ETH Zurich.",
21116,"The work, published in Nature Physics, demonstrates that it is possible to reach the minimum energy state for the three motional directions.",

21119,Innsbruck physicists found a new way to entangle high-dimensional quantum systems.,
21120,Recently quantum computers started to work with more than just the zeros and ones we know from classical computers.,
21121,"Now a team at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, demonstrates a way to efficiently create entanglement of such high-dimensional systems to enable more powerful calculations.",
21122,"In the world of computing, we typically think of information as being stored as ones and zeros – also known as binary encoding.",
21123,"However, in our daily life we use ten digits to represent all possible numbers.",
21124,"In binary the number 9 is written as 1001 for example, requiring three additional digits to represent the same thing.",
21125,"The quantum computers of today grew out of this binary paradigm, but in fact the physical systems that encode their quantum bits (qubit) often have the potential to also encode quantum digits (qudits), as recently demonstrated by a team led by Martin Ringbauer at the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck.",
21126,According to experimental physicist Pavel Hrmo at ETH Zurich: “The challenge for qudit-based quantum computers has been to efficiently create entanglement between the high-dimensional information carriers.”,
21127,"In a study published in the journal Nature Communications the team at the University of Innsbruck now reports, how two qudits can be fully entangled with each other with unprecedented performance, paving the way for more efficient and powerful quantum computers.",
21128,"The example of the number 9 shows that, while humans are able calculate 9 x 9 = 81 in one single step, a classical computer (or calculator) has to take 1001 x 1001 and perform many steps of binary multiplication behind the scenes before it is able to display 81 on the screen.",
21129,"Classically, we can afford to do this, but in the quantum world where computations are inherently sensitive to noise and external disturbances, we need to reduce the number of operations required to make the most of available quantum computers.",
21130,Crucial to any calculation on a quantum computer is quantum entanglement.,
21131,Entanglement is one of the unique quantum features that underpin the potential for quantum to greatly outperform classical computers in certain tasks.,
21132,"Yet, exploiting this potential requires the generation of robust and accurate higher-dimensional entanglement.",
21133,"The researchers at the University of Innsbruck were now able to fully entangle two qudits, each encoded in up to 5 states of individual Calcium ions.",
21134,"This gives both theoretical and experimental physicists a new tool to move beyond binary information processing, which could lead to faster and more robust quantum computers.",
21135,"Martin Ringbauer explains: “Quantum systems have many available states waiting to be used for quantum computing, rather than limiting them to work with qubits.”",
21136,"Many of todays most challenging problems, in fields as diverse as chemistry, physics or optimisation, can benefit from this more natural language of quantum computing.",

21138,"Atmospheric scientist Thomas Karl examines the air above Innsbruck, Austria.",
21139,"Long-term measurements in the urban area of Innsbruck, Austria, show that the fraction of ozone near the surface tends to be overestimated in atmospheric models.",
21140,"Consequently, a fundamental assumption for air quality forecasting has to be reinterpreted for urban areas.",
21141,Measurements by an international team led by atmospheric scientist Thomas Karl of the University of Innsbruck also show that direct nitrogen dioxide emissions are overestimated.,
21142,"The 40-meter-high monitoring tower of the Innsbruck Atmospheric Observatory near the city center of Innsbruck in Austria, Europe, continuously provides data on the composition of the atmosphere near the surface.",
21143,"Every hour, 36,000 data points are recorded.",
21144,Using a special measuring method – the so-called eddy covariance method – the concentration of air components can be continuously monitored.,
21145,"An international team led by Thomas Karl from the Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences at the University of Innsbruck has now used these data to study the chemistry of ozone, nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in urban areas in detail.",
21146,The high proportion of diesel vehicles in European cities leads to strong concentrations of nitrogen monoxide.,
21147,This reacts with ozone to produce nitrogen dioxide.,
21148,"In the atmosphere, nitrogen dioxide decomposes again to nitrogen monoxide and atomic oxygen, which immediately combines with atmospheric oxygen to form ozone.",
21149,This chemical cycle was described mathematically over 60 years ago in the first air pollution textbook by Philip Leighton.,
21150,The relationship between the two processes has since been referred to as the Leighton ratio.,
21151,"Computer models of atmospheric chemistry use the Leighton ratio to minimize complexity by deriving the concentration of ozone, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide from the concentration of each of the other two.",
21152,"In practice, this has been used, for example, to derive ozone concentrations in areas polluted by nitrogen oxides.",
21153,"The Innsbruck atmospheric researchers data now show that in the presence of high nitrogen monoxide emissions, computational simplifications made by Leighton lead to incorrect results.",
21154,"Thomas Karl points out that “in cities with high nitrogen monoxide emissions, this ratio can be overestimated by up to 50 percent, which can lead to model calculations overestimating ground-level ozone concentrations in urban areas.”",
21155,"The effect of chemistry – turbulence interactions plays a significant role in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, up to 200 meters above the ground.",
21156,", Responsible for the effect studied in Innsbruck is the combination of strong turbulence in urban areas in the presence of high nitrogen monoxide emissions. .",
21157,The mixing of the gases combined with the relatively rapid chemical processes lead to more ozone being converted into nitrogen dioxide.,
21158,The researchers data also show that direct emissions of nitrogen dioxide from urban traffic are largely negligible in comparison to secondary formation.,
21159,"“It remains important to note that environmental regulations do not rely on model calculations but come into effect depending on actual measured pollutant concentrations,” Thomas Karl emphasized.",
21160,", The results have now been published in Science Advances.",
21161,"The research was conducted jointly with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (USA), Case Western Reserve University (USA), Wageningen University (NL) and Luftblick (AT), and was financially supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF and the European Space Agency ESA, among others.
",
21162,"As of 1 January 2023, the University of Klagenfurt has the following faculties: The University of Klagenfurt celebrates its 50th anniversary in the year 2020.",
21163,The year of festivities will commence with a ceremonial act on 21 January 2020.,
21164,"After extensive preparations, the new “Digital Age Research Center (D!ARC)” is established at the University of Klagenfurt on 01.01.2019.",
21165,"At the beginning of the academic year, the University of Klagenfurt was ceremoniously opened following the completion of extensive renovation work, revealing a modern space that is flooded with light.",
21166,"The newly renovated campus was shortlisted for the Prix Versailles – Campuses, which is under UNESCO patronage.",
21167,Comprehensive renovation works take place at AAU from 2016 to 2018.,
21168,"During these renovation works, the Main Building and North Wing are outfitted with the very latest technologies.",
21169,"The renovation works also bring many other benefits, such as more light, air, transparency and modern learning and teaching spaces.",
21170,"Founded in 2015, the Karl Popper Kolleg is an institute for PhD students and advanced study that encourages sustainable collaborations between talented young researchers and international researchers at the very top of their field.",
21171,"The Karl Popper Kolleg makes an important contribution to the accessibility, internationalisation and reputation of the region.",
21172,AAU works together with a number of other universities from the Entwicklungsverbund Süd-Ost (EVSO or South-eastern Curriculum Development Network) to redesign secondary level teacher training.,
21173,Since WS 2015/16 students taking teacher training programmes with the EVSO have been able to follow a common curriculum for the “General Training in Secondary-Level Education” programme.,
21174,"The School of Education (SoE) is set up as a Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt university centre, with the aim of redesigning and centralising teacher training programmes at the university.  ",
21175,Another building is added to the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt campus: the Servicegebäude building.,
21176,"All programmes of study have now been transferred to the Bologna structure and are organised as Bachelor’s, Master’s or Doctoral programmes.",
21177,"The M/O/T, the “Alpen-Adria School of Management, Organisational Development and Technology”, is founded.",
21178,The aim of the School is to centralise and develop additional MBA and Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) programmes for managers.,
21179,The Faculty of Technical Sciences is established in 2007.,
21180,"The Faculty of Management and Economics and Informatics, which had been in existence since 1994, splits into the Faculty of Management and Economics (with 16 professors) and the Faculty of Technical Sciences (with 19 professors).",
21181,Austria’s most modern University Sports Institute (USI) opens on campus.,
21182,"Each semester, members of the university can take part in up to 160 sports courses and camps.  ",
21183,The university is renamed Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt.,
21184,The interuniversity Faculty for Interdisciplinary Studies (FIS) also becomes a third faculty at this time.,
21185,The process of developing technical subjects at the university is under way.,
21186,"As a result of the Bologna Process, a new degree structure is implemented at the university.",
21187,Bachelor’s degree programmes accept their first students.,
21188,"A new Universities Act is enacted, the Universities Act 2002 (UG 02).",
21189,"Through this act, changes are made to additional areas of Austrian university law.",
21190,"The law replaces the University Organisation Act 1993 (UOG 1993), which had been in effect up to this date.  ",
21191,The university continues to grow and needs new space for its rapidly growing programmes in Applied Business Administration and Applied Informatics.,
21192,A new annex building is therefore opened in 2000 (the South Wing).,
21193,"With the opening of this wing, the university gains three new lecture halls.",
21194,The name of the university is changed to the University of Klagenfurt.,
21195,The Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Management and Economics are also set up.,
21196,"In 1983, the university heads in a new direction.",
21197,"It expands its subject portfolio with two programmes, one in “Applied Business Administration” and the other in “Applied Informatics”.",
21198,The university starts a process of internationalisation and enters into partnership agreements with international universities.,
21199,The university enters into 28 partnership agreements for research and teaching exchanges the same year.,
21200,The Interuniversity Research Institute for Distance-Learning is founded.,
21201,In 1991 the Institute is renamed the Interuniversity Faculty for Interdisciplinary Studies (IFF).,
21202,"The IFF has facilities in Klagenfurt, Vienna and Graz.",
21203,"After the introduction of regular degree programmes in 1973, the University for Educational Sciences holds its first graduation ceremony in 1977.",
21204,"After four years of building works, the opening ceremony is held for the main building of the University for Educational Sciences.",
21205,"It is at this time that the university’s larger lecture halls, Lecture Hall 1 to 4, are first made available for use.",
21206,The first sitting of the Senate (then called the Universitätskollegium) takes place in 1976.,
21207,"With the introduction of the University Organisation Act in 1975, the Senate becomes the highest governing body in a university.  ",
21208,The new University Organisation Act comes into force in 1975.,
21209,This prompts the College for Educational Sciences to be renamed the University for Educational Sciences.,
21210,Construction of the Main Building and North Wing commences in 1974.,
21211,"During the construction works, the size of the building and the College for Educational Studies grows considerably.",
21212,The way is now clear for the college’s expansion.  ,
21213,In 1973 the college starts to offer regular degree programmes.,
21214,"The Klagenfurt college now offers diploma, teacher training and Doctoral programmes in Philosophy, Educational Studies, History, German Studies, English and American Studies, Romance Studies, Slavonic Studies, Mathematics, Geography and Linguistics.  ",
21215,Research and teaching activities are quickly established at the new College for Educational Sciences.,
21216,Klagenfurt’s first doctorate is awarded in 1972.  ,
21217,"After the Federal law passes, construction starts on the college’s first building.",
21218,In 1971 the building known as the “Vorstufengebäude” is given over to the College for Educational Sciences.  ,
21219,The efforts of the Universitätsbund association and other supporters of the initiative pay off: the Federal law on establishing the College for Educational Sciences is passed.,
21220,The path has now been cleared for the college.,
21221,The project is now focused on accelerating the establishment of a “College for Educational Sciences in Klagenfurt”.,
21222,The supporters of the Klagenfurt college initiate the “Klagenfurt Business School” project.,
21223,The Universitätsbund association is set up to support the establishment of a college in Klagenfurt.,
21224,"The Universitätsbund is a friend’s association of the university to this day and supports its projects and excursions.
",
21225,Public service broadcasting has a statutory mandate.,
21226,This includes a certain level of diversity in its programming.,
21227,The shift to digital formats combined with the use of recommender systems can jeopardise this diversity.,
21228,Can a recommender system tuned for diversity step in and recommend alternatives?,
21229,Nikolaus Poechhacker is a researcher and lecturer who works in the research group “Digital Culture” at the Digital Age Research Center (D!ARC).,
21230,"He focuses on the interface between society, law and technology.  ",
21231,"“I am interested in understanding how the practical implementation of digital systems changes social institutions,” Nikolaus Poechhacker explains.",
21232,His PhD thesis discusses the example of the development of a recommender system for public broadcasters.,
21233,"The high degree of complexity at the interface of technology, society and law is particularly challenging: “It is not enough just to be able to implement something technically.",
21234,"In this example, you also have to have the challenge to operationalise diversity in such a way that it can mediate between different social groups.”",
21235,"The digitalisation of asylum procedures, for example, which uses voice recognition software to determine where applicants come from, is similarly complex and should be viewed critically.",
21236,"Nikolaus Poechhacker mentions another example, with work done by Prof. Tina Ehrke-Rabel from the University of Graz:",
21237,The tax audits carried out by the tax office have also become highly automated.,
21238,"Often, an algorithm decides who is audited: “The patterns are very subtle.",
21239,"For a long time, you’re not on their radar.",
21240,"But once you are selected for an audit, you won’t be able to get out of it for ages.”",
21241,"As we question whether this might perhaps be unfair, a smiling Nikolaus Poechhacker informs us: “It’s not unfair, because you don’t have a right not to be audited.”",
21242,"Poechhacker studied sociology in Vienna, took courses in computer science at the same time and completed his Master’s degree in “Science-Technology-Society”.",
21243,He headed to the TU Munich for his doctoral studies.,
21244,"After spending almost two years as a sociologist specialising in law and technology at the Department of Public Law and Political Science at the University of Graz, Nikolaus Poechhacker joined D!ARC as a Senior Scientist in early 2022.",
21245,"“We have little awareness of the technologies used by state institutions and the impact this has on us,” he explains.",
21246,"When court decisions are influenced by algorithms, as is already happening in the US in some cases, everyone should be aware of this.",
21247,"“For sensitive, public areas, we need more transparency.",
21248,"In comparison, I don’t need much transparency regarding the algorithm that recommends shows to me on the streaming platform.”",
21249,"Poechhacker believes that the younger generation has a high level of digital literacy, especially when it comes to frequently used platforms: “We see this with YouTube.",
21250,"‘Like us, because it helps us with the algorithm,’ is a common phrase there.”",
21251,"But who needs to know what is happening on the practical platforms that shape our everyday lives: “In the case of search engines, transparency would have the opposite effect; everyone would try to manipulate the rankings in their own interest.",
21252,"So, it’s not just about transparency for the general public, but rather in relation to governance mechanisms, for instance, with regard to a regulatory body.”",
21253,"Nikolaus Poechhacker’s field of research is expanding daily, as more and more technical systems are shaping our everyday lives and thus also the administration and organisation of the state.",
21254,"„”There is a lot we don’t yet understand, and it’s worth asking unsolved questions – including the area of basic research” he concludes.  ",
21255,What motivates you to work in science?,
21256,The freedom to learn new things time and again.,
21257,I enjoy working at the interface of different disciplines because I am regularly confronted with something entirely new.,
21258,Do your parents understand your work?,
21259,That depends greatly on the level of detail.,
21260,"But using case studies, I can explain fairly well why I am interested in this and what it means on a global scale.",
21261,What’s the first thing you do in the morning?,
21262,Lots of coffee.,
21263,Do you have proper holidays?,
21264,Without thinking about your work?,
21265,"Well, I certainly try.",
21266,But I don’t quite manage it.,
21267,"On holiday, you usually have plenty of time to catch up on reading all the books you’ve acquired.",
21268,What makes you furious?,
21269,Inaccuracies.,
21270,And when people only seek counter-arguments in a discussion instead of reasoning with a person.,
21271,And what calms you down?,
21272,Chocolate milk.,
21273,Combined with a bit of existentialist philosophy.,
21274,"Who do you regard as the greatest scientist in history, and why?",
21275,That is a very tough question.,
21276,There are many scholars who have had a lasting influence on me.,
21277,"In general, I admire people who are able to critically examine their own thinking.",
21278,"And, of course, there are all the people with whom I have had and still have the pleasure of working.",
21279,What are you afraid of?,
21280,Of being ‘done’ at some point.,
21281,And clowns.,
21282,What are you looking forward to?,
21283,Many things.,
21284,The next concert.,
21285,The next beer with friends.,
21286,"And especially my little cousins’ graduation ceremonies (which are still some way off).

21287,Alice de Benetti works as Global Search Marketing Manager at Swarovski.,
21288,"She talks to ad astra about how studying at two universities can work, how quickly markets change, and what happens when a university is open to everyone.  ",
21289,“Informatics: the hottest study program these days!”,
21290,Alice de Benetti studied the Double Degree Information Technology at the University of Klagenfurt and Udine.,
21291,This programme promotes international networking and personal development and improves cross-border career opportunities as an information manager.,
21292,"This is what we advertise, and this is precisely what de Benetti has strived for and achieved her goal.",
21293,"She works at the company’s headquarters in Switzerland, while her team is scattered around the globe.",
21294,The challenging task of managing an international team is one she has been looking for and one that requires her and her colleagues to constantly evolve every day.,
21295,“Constant learning and recognizing challenges and opportunities is ingrained in our DNA.”,
21296,"As technologies change, de Benetti focuses on recognizing how people and their behaviors adapt to the new technology.",
21297,"That, in turn, impacts the company’s market.",
21298,"De Benetti and her team identify these, tune teams to them and recommend courses of action.",
21299,“I am very proud to work for Swarovski.,
21300,"The company operates internationally and thus has a global concept, which lets me look at topics from many different angles.",
21301,"My colleagues are open-minded and charismatic, and at the same time uncomplicated, so everyone feels very comfortable.",
21302,Our managers inspire and make us feel like we are on the same level as colleagues.,
21303,So we give our best every day and identify with Swarovski’s culture.”,
21304,A straightforward career path The framework of the double degree drew de Benetti to the University of Klagenfurt and the University of Udine.,
21305,"The international approach was critical to her, and she believes the degree provided the ideal foundation for her future job.",
21306,"It was also an important step to get to know both universities, foreign places and fellow students.",
21307,"Being new and, at the same time, feeling very comfortable was a meaningful experience.",
21308,"“My studies have had a strong impact on my skills, and I realized after graduation what a huge competitive advantage it gave me.",
21309,Today I recognize even better that there is a strong demand for technology graduates*.,
21310,"The degree program prepared me ideally for the challenges I would face later on, and so I was able to follow my path from my studies, to my internship, to my current job in the best possible way.”",
21311,One university for all Studying at two universities was challenging and enriching in equal measure.,
21312,She was able to take advantage of the best of both universities.,
21313,"At the University of Klagenfurt, she was particularly impressed that the university is open throughout (24/7).",
21314,"“It is thus accessible to everyone, and it was a great experience for me to be able to come here at any time.",
21315,"In Italy, we didn’t have this possibility.",
21316,I remember how we studied for exams late into the night with fellow students.,
21317,"The university always appeared in a completely different light because of the silence of the night, because you only know the campus as busy and full of movement.",
21318,It’s a great approach: it allowed me to develop with the university fully.”,
21319,"“Start by doing what’s necessary, then what’s possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.”",
21320,"-Saint Francis of Assisi For de Benetti, setting the right personal and professional goals is crucial.",
21321,"In doing so, she incorporates her work-life balance.",
21322,"“For me, it’s important to work with passion and never give up.",
21323,"If you do something with passion, you’ve already won, and it’s easier to achieve your goals.”

21324,"Harald Gietler has just finished his PhD in Technical Sciences, specializing in Information and Communications Engineering.",
21325,His research work focuses on localization technology.,
21326,"Instead of radar or sonar, Harald uses electromagnetic fields.",
21327,We talked to him about his field of research and the influence of artificial intelligence.,
21328,"Moreover, he also told us about the reasons why he decided to study at the University of Klagenfurt and why he would advise others to study in Klagenfurt too.",
21329,How do you explain to your neighbor at the garden fence what you are working on?,
21330,I outline my field of research as localization technology like radar or sonar.,
21331,"In contrast to those, I use electromagnetic fields instead of radar or acoustic waves.",
21332,"However, the goal is similar, i.e., localization of a moving target.",
21333,"Especially with the ever-increasing number of robotic systems in our daily lives, localization of robots to enhance their internal navigation and collaboration with other robots, humans, and the environment is crucial.",
21334,What do you know about your research question after completing your doctoral thesis that you didn’t know before?,
21335,The answer to many questions is not straightforward.,
21336,"Often, the answer is a compromise between involved factors.",
21337,"Depending on specific requirements, the parameters of choice can differ.",
21338,Why did you decide to study at the University of Klagenfurt?,
21339,Why did you choose Klagenfurt?,
21340,There are many reasons why I studied in Klagenfurt.,
21341,"However, the most important ones are the area of research, the excellent quality of supervision, and the local surroundings such as mountains and lakes.",
21342,Are there still new things for you to experience at the university?,
21343,"Since the university offers a wide range of study branches that attract different human beings, I regularly meet people with different opinions and ideologies.",
21344,This is a beautiful aspect of the university because it is always exciting and stops me from getting lost in my technical bubble.,
21345,Has your view of the world changed as a result of your studies?,
21346,"If the results of my studies didn’t change my view of the world, the long path leading to the results certainly did.",
21347,"Setbacks and achievements, critical thinking, and the opportunity to teach students opened my mind to a broader view of life.",
21348,Why should one study here at the University of Klagenfurt?,
21349,The University of Klagenfurt offers a variety of study branches with excellent supervision.,
21350,"Furthermore, the support when doing a semester abroad and its location in beautiful mother nature are invaluable.",
21351,What would be important advice for new students?,
21352,"Follow what interests you, and don’t be upset by setbacks.",
21353,Where do you see yourself in ten years?,
21354,Hopefully still in a position where I can research exciting topics.,
21355,"What would you be doing now, if you hadn’t become a scientist?",
21356,"Most likely, I’d be working as a development engineer in the technology sector.",
21357,Do your parents understand what it is you are working on?,
21358,I am very confident that they understand in general what I am working on.,
21359,"Maybe not down to the very last detail, but they have a good sense of my research’s implications and potential applications.",
21360,What’s the first thing you do when you get to the office in the morning?,
21361,"After turning on the computer, I usually start reading e-mails while drinking a coffee and reading notes I made on my current research.",
21362,Do you have proper holidays?,
21363,Without thinking about your work?,
21364,"Yes, I am delighted that I can enjoy my holidays to the fullest and be able to leave the thoughts about my work behind until I am back.",
21365,What makes you furious?,
21366,"Nothing specific, but occasional things such as being stuck in a traffic jam when in a hurry.",
21367,And what calms you down?,
21368,I engage in several different sports that help me calm down and forget my worries.,
21369,"Who do you regard as the greatest scientist in history, and why?",
21370,I don’t think it’s possible to name a single person.,
21371,Progress is based on the work of many.,
21372,"If I were forced to choose one, I would mention James Clerk Maxwell because his work significantly influences mine.",
21373,What are you afraid of?,
21374,Obtaining unsatisfactory results from experiments that have been planned far in advance.,
21375,What are you looking forward to?,
21376,"Apart from the upcoming holidays, I am looking forward to some fascinating, tightly scheduled experiments.

21377,Marie Meyer-Marktl studied Business Administration at the University of Klagenfurt.,
21378,"She started her career in controlling, then became pricing manager and finally CFO of a high-turnover international company.",
21379,Today she is self-employed and supports people as a coach in finding a fulfilling and successful working life.,
21380,Visitors to the connect job & career fair were also treated to her expertise – her career speed coaching sessions and the impulse lecture were very well attended.,
21381,"In the interview, Marie Meyer-Marktl gives insights into her career change journey, talks about how her time as a student and the international experiences contributed to this decision, and reveals how students and graduates can find their dream job.",
21382,"Marie Meyer-Marktl, after completing your degree in Business Administration, you started in the traditional field of controlling and, with a lot of drive and ambition, steadily expanded your area of responsibility until you eventually became the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a large company.",
21383,How did this come about and what motivated you in the world of facts and figures?,
21384,"As a junior controller, I initially made a lot of mistakes.",
21385,The company in Vienna was very patient and acknowledged my development potential as a young professional.,
21386,"After some time, however, we jointly realised that my strengths did not lie in reporting.",
21387,I became a business partner in controlling and was able to very successfully develop new areas with managers and colleagues and support them in projects.,
21388,An internal career development programme then enabled me to take the next career step.,
21389,I moved to Berlin and was allowed to work on an international project as pricing manager.,
21390,"It was an exciting, turbulent and intense time.",
21391,"I was particularly proud to have mastered an internal audit well, thanks to my controlling expertise.",
21392,"Working with colleagues from Switzerland, France, China and India was also very rewarding.",
21393,I was equally impressed by life in the big city of Berlin – the city is bubbling over with internationality and innovative spirit.,
21394,"In 2016, I was offered the position of CFO for the northern region, based in Hamburg.",
21395,I accepted the challenge.,
21396,"I appreciated the cooperation in the team and the supportive approach of my supervisor, but increasingly realised that I was not in the right place in terms of content.",
21397,I felt like an artist who is only allowed to choose two colours from a colour palette.,
21398,All the others were off-limits.,
21399,This led to a professional shift in mindset.,
21400,What was decisive for your personal change process?,
21401,"Even during my time in Berlin, but more so in Hamburg, I was already interested in the topic of professional orientation.",
21402,I went in search of my “why” and my “purpose”.,
21403,"During my time as a student, I dealt with the topic intensively at the corporate level.",
21404,"During my business degree, I learned a lot about the fact that companies need a reason for existence and a vision.",
21405,"During my time in Germany, I realised that this idea is also very important for me as an individual.",
21406,"My search for meaning became steadily more intense and so I ended up in Ethiopia in 2016, where I worked on a project as an English teacher.",
21407,"In 2017, I started my training as a coach, which took me over a year.",
21408,"In 2019, I finally took the plunge into self-employment.",
21409,"Today, I support people in finding a fulfilling and successful working life.",
21410,I accompany the change process with individual coaching sessions.,
21411,Did your international experience contribute to your change process?,
21412,"Yes, definitely!",
21413,I lived in many different countries as a student and in a professional context and travelled a lot.,
21414,"Through these international experiences, I not only got to know other countries and people better, but also myself.",
21415,There were many experiences that inspired and shaped me a lot.,
21416,"In Ethiopia, for example, I talked with my adult students about time and its meaning.",
21417,They absolutely could not identify with my view that “time is money”.,
21418,"Rather,“time is family and friends” was their most important statement.",
21419,"My supervisor also made me think with his advice that “at the end of the day, you need to be happy, nothing else”.",
21420,What motivates you in your role as a coach?,
21421,"Clarity, knowledge and courage are the three core ingredients for a professional change – this is where I accompany and empower my clients.",
21422,The diversity makes this task so exciting.,
21423,I work with people from different age groups in a wide range of life situations.,
21424,"Accordingly, I design my coaching sessions individually – there are no prefabricated video courses.",
21425,"When my clients experience change and find a job that feels good, it makes me happy and proud.",
21426,This kind of sense of achievement motivates me a lot.,
21427,Did your studies also prepare you for these activities as a coach?,
21428,"Yes, definitely.",
21429,There are incredibly layered parallels between strategic business management and a fulfilling and successful working life.,
21430,Strategic controlling in particular provides plenty of inspiration for my professional work as a coach for individuals.,
21431,The experiences I had abroad during my studies were also very beneficial.,
21432,What tips can you give students and graduates to help them find a fulfilling working life?,
21433,"In my keynote speech at the connect job and career fair, I was able to share the following three guiding principles with the visitors: It is my vision that people wake up bright-eyed on Monday mornings and think happy thoughts about work.",
21434,There is still a lot to do!,
21435,"A few words with Marie Meyer-Marktl A happy moment at the University of Klagenfurt was… when I was able to get to know many different entrepreneurs in an entrepreneurship course, all of whom were passionate about their businesses.",
21436,And I associate the university parties with fun times.,
21437,I loved dancing till late into the night 😉,
21438,"From my student years, I’m still accompanied by… my best friend Christin.",
21439,Who inspired you?,
21440,Every encounter with people is inspiring.,
21441,"Simon Sinek, John Strelecky and Stephan Covey have had a great influence on me.",
21442,"If I were to study again, I would… give philosophy a try.",
21443,"My university experience in 4 words: varied – exciting – familiar – international (USA with joint study, trip to China, internshipin Mainz, mentoring of foreign students)",
21444,An unforgettable experience during my time as a student was… my time abroad in the USA and mentoring 4 Japanese students in Klagenfurt.,
21445,Those were really exciting times!,
21446,"When I think of the University of Klagenfurt, I immediately think of.. a family atmosphere and togetherness, you are not just a number here.
",
21447,Markus Slamanig studied Applied Business Administration and Business and Law at the University of Klagenfurt.,
21448,"For the past ten years, he has been living in Florida.",
21449,In this interview he tells us about the time he spent abroad during his studies and how he was drawn back to America after graduation.  ,
21450,Why did you choose the University of Klagenfurt?,
21451,I love Carinthia.,
21452,"Besides, the University of Klagenfurt is a great institution.",
21453,"One memorable experience during my time as a student was … The uni parties, studying for finals, writing the theses – all of them were unforgettable moments between fun and work.",
21454,"When I think of the University of Klagenfurt, I immediately think of … Home, Carinthia, and the “good old times”.",
21455,Did you spend time abroad?,
21456,Yes.,
21457,"While studying, I was in Pensacola (Florida) in a joint study programme.",
21458,"After studying, I came to Miami and Fort Lauderdale (Florida) where I currently live and work.",
21459,How did those experiences shape you?,
21460,"The periods abroad opened up different views of the world, a receptiveness to other cultures and ways of life, and experiences that I would not have had otherwise.",
21461,"Both professionally and privately, life abroad was or is different and more challenging – you have to start from scratch.",
21462,Things that you take for granted are not in fact self-evident.,
21463,Do you have any tips for todays students wishing to go abroad?,
21464,"At any rate, it’s a great experience, it looks good on your CV and it may also have a serious impact on your further professional and personal career.",
21465,How did you end up in your current job/activity?,
21466,How did your career develop?,
21467,I applied 😊,
21468,"When I came to America some eleven years ago, I was a student at Florida International University completing my MBA.",
21469,"During this time, I forged contacts with a small German-American consulting firm.",
21470,"After my green card application was approved, I stayed with the company for a while and eventually moved to Deloitte Consulting last year.",
21471,What is it about your job that you particularly appreciate?,
21472,"I love working in teams, provided everyone contributes and is motivated to work.",
21473,"The really good thing about my work is that it is mostly project work, where no two projects are the same; however, this does not only mean a lot of variety, but also challenges.",
21474,Did your studies prepare you for your current job?,
21475,"The degree programme prepares you in the sense that you learn to organise yourself, plan things and implement them over a defined period of time.",
21476,These generic skills and the willingness to acquire new knowledge are basic prerequisites for a successful career.,
21477,How do you define success?,
21478,Professional success means having a suitable job that allows a good work-life balance.,
21479,"Private success means family, one/two children, ideally a house, and the freedom to enjoy holidays and certain leisure activities without being restricted financially.",
21480,Do you have a (life) motto?,
21481,"Live, and let live.",
21482,What advice would you give to today’s students?,
21483,Define a long-term goal.,
21484,"Then, keep studying hard to reach that goal.",
21485,What do you do to balance your professional life?,
21486,"I like going to the beach, sports and listening to music.",
21487,A few words with Markus Slamanig A happy moment at the University of Klagenfurt was… receiving my graduation certificate.,
21488,From my student days I still have… all my course materials relating to ABWL.,
21489,"If I were to study again, I would… possibly enjoy my time at university even more.",
21490,"My university experience in 4 words: organisation, planning, determination, sustainability.  ",
21491,"Markus Slamanig is a Carinthian of the world.
",
21492,The mathematician was invited to contribute to the key profile area “Quantum Matter and Materials” at the University of Cologne as a member of the Global Faculty.,
21493,"There, she is working at the interface between mathematics and quantum physics.  ",
21494,"“Mathematics is not something that takes place in secret or in seclusion”, says Angelika Wiegele, a professor at the Department of Mathematics.",
21495,"Instead, the invigorating exchange with colleagues is essential for developing new ideas.",
21496,"“If we put our heads together, the result is ultimately far greater than simply the sum of those heads”, she reckons.",
21497,Angelika Wiegele is currently part of the Global Faculty at the University of Cologne.,
21498,"This project allows the key profile areas of the University of Cologne to invite academics as visiting scholars for a defined period of time, and these scholars also undertake to contribute to research and teaching.",
21499,The coordinators invited Angelika Wiegele to contribute to one of the profile areas producing outstanding research work.,
21500,"In terms of content, she is working on “Quantum Matter and Materials”.",
21501,But what does mathematics have to do with physics?,
21502,Wiegele explains: “The quantum state of a particle can be described as a semidefinite optimisation problem.,
21503,"And it is precisely these optimisation problems that are the subject of my research, albeit in a completely different area until now, namely in combinatorial optimisation.”",
21504,"In Cologne, Angelika Wiegele’s daily interactions now mainly involve working with mathematicians and physicists, and she draws the following conclusion: “We can benefit greatly from each other.”",
21505,"Because physics is not offered as a dedicated subject in Klagenfurt, Wiegele’s residency in Cologne presents her with a unique opportunity: “Problems that I have been aware of for a very long time from one angle, I can now see in a completely new context.",
21506,"In quantum mechanics, these problems occur perfectly naturally and constitute an exact description rather than approximations to problems, as is the case, for example, in combinatorial optimisation.",
21507,"In a sense, semidefinite optimisation is the quantum version of linear optimisation.”",
21508,Participation in the Global Faculty “Quantum Matter and Materials” at the University of Cologne covers the years 2022 and 2023.,
21509,Angelika Wiegele is currently in Cologne for two full months.,
21510,"Spending a period abroad involves considerable logistical and bureaucratic effort, but it is well worth it in her eyes.",
21511,"Quizzed about whether mathematics is an international discipline without cultural differences, she states: “In mathematics, as in other natural science and technical subjects, we have an ideal global means of communication in the form of the mathematical language.",
21512,We rarely have to deal with cultural barriers.,
21513,The same applies to the degree programmes: The curriculum for a degree in mathematics only varies very slightly across the globe.”,
21514,"The fact that this is also evident in the practical implementation of degree programmes can be seen clearly at the University of Klagenfurt: Here, the Master’s degree programme “Mathematics” – open to international students – has been taught entirely in English since 2018.

21515,"“Family businesses are the backbone of the economy,” as Valdet Hadri, who is pursuing his doctorate at the University of Klagenfurt under the supervision of Dieter Bögenhold (Department of Sociology), explains.",
21516,Valdet Hadri is interested in the unique specificities associated with migrant (family) businesses.  ,
21517,"Elaborating on his research related to family and migrant entrepreneurship, he explains: “What place do they occupy in the economy?",
21518,What form does the interaction between family and business take?,
21519,Do they send remittances to their countries of origin and what are their motives for doing so?,
21520,These are just some of the questions I want to find answers to.”,
21521,"The focus is on Kosovo, where Valdet Hadri lives.",
21522,He explores two issues in a series of qualitative studies.,
21523,"On the one hand, he wants to investigate why Kosovo migrant entrepreneurs send remittances to Kosovo family enterprises: Is it because they feel obliged?",
21524,Do they feel sorry for their families?,
21525,Do they assume they will need something from their families of origin at some point in the future?,
21526,"On the other hand, the entrepreneurship activities among Kosovar migrants in Austria are at the core of Valdet Hadri’s research: Do they operate in specific business areas?",
21527,Why is this the case?,
21528,How do traditions and innovations merge in these companies?,
21529,Valdet Hadri is currently in the third year of his doctoral studies.,
21530,A paper centred around a literature review is currently undergoing peer review.,
21531,"Valdet Hadri is being supported within the framework of Young Scientists Mentoring, which also encourages the continuous exchange, and in his case,with his host supervisor Prof. Daniela Bolzani from the University of Bologna.",
21532,"Valdet`s educational journey is marked by the difficult political situation in his home country and the region: When war broke out in 1999, he had to put his studies on hold for a few years.",
21533,"However, he went on to complete his Bachelor’s degree in “Banking, Finance and Accounting, Economics” and a Master’s degree in “Marketing and Business Management” at the AAB College in Pristina and he has also worked in several EU projects.",
21534,"Since 2019, he has served as the Senior Officer for Budget and Finance Analysis at the Kosovo Assembly.",
21535,"As part of his work, he is responsible for the analysis of Kosovo’s national budget.",
21536,This is also the source of his research interest: “Around 1.2 billion euros in remittances flew into Kosovo in the last year.,
21537,These funds play an important role in the economy of my home country.,
21538,"We currently don’t know much about why migrants’ money flows back and we struggle to properly assess the situation of the impact of the remittances”, Valdet Hadri reports.",
21539,Valdet Hadri became aware of the University of Klagenfurt while visiting his uncle in Klagenfurt in 2018 thatcame to Austria in the mid-1990s to work here.,
21540,"During the visit with his family, Hadri was attracted to visit the university building – and then looked into the possibility of earning a doctoral degree here.",
21541,"At times, balancing his studies with his own research, job and family can be a challenge for Valdet Hadri.",
21542,"He tells us with a grin: “My wife keeps asking, ‘Aren’t you almost done yet?’”",
21543,"He knows that he wants, to continue spending time on research after completing his doctorate because: “It’s always fun to do something new”.  ",
21544,What motivates you to work in science?,
21545,"Curiosity about specific issues, confidence as a sense of competence and challenge that there is something to work toward.",
21546,What’s the first thing you do in the morning?,
21547,"Usually in the morning we have coffee with my colleagues before work, and on the weekends we go out with the family",
21548,Do you have proper holidays?,
21549,Without thinking about your work?,
21550,"Yes, we do really have proper holidays as a family at least twice a year Who do you regard as the greatest scientist in history, and why?",
21551,"Albert Einstein and his remark “If I had only one hour to save the world, I would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem, and only five minutes finding the solutions.",
21552,What makes you furious?,
21553,"Usually, when people are not treated properly, especially when they are foreigners and are not treated as the natives which unfortunately have happened to me.",
21554,And what calms you down?,
21555,"Spending time with family, my wife and two kids What are you afraid of?",
21556,Maybe about losing the freedom or any pandemic/emergency situation What are you looking forward to?,
21557,"Looking forward to the next holidays with the family

21558,Digitalisation is revolutionising every aspect of economics.,
21559,"Thanks to this transformation, companies can use innovative tools to generate data volumes in the googol byte range.",
21560,They need state-of-the-art management science methods to ensure that insights potentially contained in the data can be used in a meaningful and purposeful way to achieve success.,
21561,Experts specialising in this cross-sectional subject – which cuts across all areas of data science and economics – will receive academic training at the University of Klagenfurt from the winter semester of 2023/24.  ,
21562,"Economic success, the realisation of environmental goals, our coexistence in society: To a large extent, all of this is based on the professional management of data in our day and age.",
21563,The research projects being undertaken by scholars teaching in the new degree programme illustrate the vast range of application areas: Researchers calculate and analyse important economic relationships.,
21564,"For instance, they strive to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of monetary policy on the demand for money in order to better manage economic crises.",
21565,"They collaborate on the concept of the sharing economy, which has the potential to change the transport and logistics industry for good, but also on issues of health economics, such as the impact of parenthood on health and mortality.",
21566,Students in the new Master’s degree programme have the choice of two majors: ‘Business Analytics’ and ‘International Business & Economics’.,
21567,The major in ‘Business Analytics’ addresses the challenge of digitalisation and integrates the (machine) processing and analysis of business and process data with the economic consideration of this data and subsequent decision-making.,
21568,"Graduates completing the major ‘International Business and Economics’ are equipped above all with quantitative-analytical skills relating to the intersection of management science, economics and business studies, as well as environmental economics and sustainability.",
21569,"Registration for the special admission procedure for the new English-language Master’s degree programme “Management, Economics, and Data Science” started a few weeks ago.",
21570,"“We are seeing a large influx of prospective students from all over the world who are applying to study in Klagenfurt after having obtained very diverse and consistently excellent Bachelor’s degrees,” says Programme Director Paul Schweinzer (Department of Economics).",
21571,These prospective students are finding the doors wide open: The programme is open to all Bachelor’s graduates with a similar subject background who have earned at least 30 ECTS credits in business administration and 15 ECTS credits in mathematics/statistics.,
21572,"In addition, students must usually pass a GRE test and demonstrate proficiency in English.",
21573,"Prospective students can register for the special admission procedure at https://www.aau.at/en/studien/master-management-economics-and-data-science/ until 15 July.

21574,"According to the latest QS World University Rankings (WUR) 2023, the University of Klagenfurt has achieved its best ranking to date, moving up from the 501-510 ranking group (last year) to rank 486.",
21575,"For the first time ever, the university is among the top 500 and has been ranked among the best.  ",
21576,"Following its steady progression in the years 2020 (601-650), 2021 (511-520) and 2022 (501-510), the university has advanced to rank 486 in the 2023 edition of the QS World University Rankings.",
21577,The powerful upward trend at the University of Klagenfurt continues in the most recent 2023 edition.,
21578,"The university has climbed by 215 places since 2014, as the QS chart shows: Ranking trend: Chart: QS World University Rankings 2023  ",
21579,"This year, 1,422 universities (from a total of 2,472 institutions) across 100 sites were assessed according to six indicators, compared to 1,300 (out of 1,673) in the previous year.",
21580,"In the QS World University Rankings, 40 percent of the placement is determined by the results of an international survey among the academic community on the reputation of universities (Academic Reputation), and another ten percent by an additional survey among employers (Employer Reputation).",
21581,Another 20 percent of the rating is based respectively on the ratio of students to teachers (Faculty/Student Ratio) and on the research performance measured by citations (Citations per Faculty).,
21582,Five percent each can be attributed to the proportion of international students (International Student Ratio) and international academics (International Staff Ratio).,
21583,"In terms of the “International Student Ratio” indicator, the University of Klagenfurt recorded the fastest growth and now ranks 136th in the world, improving its ranking by 26 places compared to the previous year.",
21584,"In addition to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings (THE) and the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking), the QS ranking is one of the most important global university rankings worldwide.",
21585,"The University of Klagenfurt is included in all three rankings.
",
21586,"We asked our international student Gian Marco Palazzoni, who is enrolled in the Bachelor’s Programme International Business and Economics, why he came to Klagenfurt and what he likes about studying here.  ",
21587,Why did you come to Klagenfurt for the Bachelor’s Programme International Business and Economics?,
21588,"I went to High School in Central Italy, in Siena, which is in Tuscany.",
21589,"My brother studied in Villach and I really wanted to study economics, but I did not want to study it in Italy because I honestly think it is a topic that has to be embraced in a global way – and an English study programme with a focus on international economic relations represents the global way.",
21590,"So, I started to look for universities in Europe, because my parents did not want me to move too far away.",
21591,I also looked at universities in Austria because had a good feeling about the country.,
21592,The University of Klagenfurt was one of the possibilities I considered.,
21593,"I decided to try it, and I am really glad I did, because there is an entrance test for the IBEC programme and I passed!",
21594,"Did you consider other universities, too?",
21595,Why did you choose Klagenfurt in the end?,
21596,Was it something special about the programme or the university?,
21597,"I had some options in Italy at universities with English study programmes, but I really wanted to embrace the opportunity of gaining an intercultural perspective as opposed to the national perspective.",
21598,"As I wanted to stay close to my home country, the choice was either Vienna or Klagenfurt.",
21599,"Add the fact that the IBEC programme is so specific and a really good size, because we are just 50 students in the programme: this really helped me make my decision, because I like the fact that you can have a kind of relationship with your professors, where they remember your face, they know who you are.",
21600,"You are made to feel that you matter, that you are important.",
21601,So I gave it a shot and I think it is just great.,
21602,How long have you been here now?,
21603,"I arrived at the end of September, so I am in my second semester.",
21604,"So now that you have already started, are you enjoying it here?",
21605,Would you like to tell prospective students something about Klagenfurt?,
21606,What I really think is great about the programme is that the professors know who we are and the professors have a good relationship with us.,
21607,"They give us assignments every week, they stay focused on us.",
21608,They guide our development and follow it closely.,
21609,"And about Klagenfurt in general, I think the city is great.",
21610,I am not the kind of guy who likes big cities.,
21611,"I love the fact that it is a city, but it is also manageable in terms of size and it is safe.",
21612,"Just the fact that the buses are always on time and the city is very clean and very green, there is the beautiful lake… I love it.",
21613,"I really think it is a very international city, because I have met people from all around the world, South Africa, Canada, Australia… One of the mandatory classes at the start of the programme was called “intercultural skills”.",
21614,"We had the opportunity to meet people from around the world, and I worked on a project with a girl from South America, from Brazil.",
21615,"Working with someone who comes from an entirely different place than I do and, let’s say, meeting in between, in our methods, in everything, was a really good experience.",
21616,"In this class, we had the chance to meet eachother and get to know each other, it was really great.",
21617,"Then there were classes, like scientific skills, where they taught us scientific English, and of course there’s also the business and economics side, which is the core of programme.",
21618,"Your Master’s is still a few steps away, but let us also talk about the prospects that the IBE Bachelor’s programme gives you.",
21619,Are you thinking about staying in Klagenfurt for the Master’s programme?,
21620,"For sure, I am regarding that as a possibility, because I think it is very interesting.",
21621,I have already informed myself about the programme.,
21622,"First of all, I am thinking of the Master’s programme in Management, Economics and Data Science.",
21623,And especially the Data Science part is becoming more and more important nowadays.,
21624,"And basically, it is very much related to everything, capturing data, analysing it and everything else.",
21625,"I am looking forward to it, because it gives prestige to the university, it is a Master’s, it is in English, and it is very specific in terms of topic and I think it will be very interesting.",
21626,Which career do you see for yourself in the future?,
21627,"I really enjoy the economics part, I have just started with macroeconomics, and I also enjoyed the microeconomics part, especially the topic of game theory, which I hope to explore in greater depth, because I loved it.",
21628,"But I don’t know yet, which career path I will choose, and I am also thinking about an academic career.",
21629,I could end up anywhere because the study programme offers so many opportunities Do you have any recommendations for prospective international students?,
21630,One of the best recommendations that I can give is this: make friends as soon as possible.,
21631,"It may not seem to be related to the study part, but the study part, which is of course the important part, that is why you are here, this part becomes so much easier, if you are not alone.",
21632,"Let me give an example: I discovered that I am not very good at studying at home, alone.",
21633,"Because in a way, I get distracted.",
21634,"Coming to the university library with a few people, that’s when things become clear and I can really focus.",
21635,"When you are studying together, everything becomes easier.",
21636,"The library is great, that is the only word I have for it, and the opening hours are exceptional.",
21637,"Probably, I would not have achieved what I have achieved, without such an open environment in the library and the people I study with.

21638,The risk of experiencing or perpetrate violence in teenage relationships is high: around 20 percent for physical violence and around 9 percent for sexual violence.,
21639,A research team of health psychologists has now conducted a systematic review study to determine the extent to which these experiences have a long-term impact.,
21640,The results show: Adolescents who experience or perpetrate teen dating violence (TDV) are more likely to report the same in adulthood.,
21641,"In addition, long-term evidence shows that youth reporting dating violence are more likely to later engage in increased risk behaviours (for example, alcohol and marijuana use) and poor mental health.  ",
21642,"“If you report dating violence as an adolescent, this can be a risk factor for a wide range of long-term consequences,” said Antonio Piolanti, a postdoctoral associate at the Department of Health Psychology at the University of Klagenfurt, summarizing the findings.",
21643,"The study, recently presented in the journal Pediatrics, fills an important research gap: While there have been numerous individual studies on the long-term associations between TDV and later outcomes, there has been no systematic review.",
21644,"For this paper, Antonio Piolanti, Franziska Waller, Iason E. Schmid, and Heather M. Foran identified 38 articles and systematically assessed the characteristics of the studies and the results.",
21645,The majority of the studies were conducted after 2010 and in the United States.,
21646,"Participants ranged in age from 13 to 18 years, and follow-ups ranged from 1 year to 35 years.",
21647,"Four types of relationship violence were analysed: physical violence, psychological or emotional violence, sexual violence, and cyber abuse.",
21648,"Commenting on the findings, Antonio Piolanti says, “The link between TDV and similar experiences in adulthood was most apparent.",
21649,This suggests that violence in relationships may be part of a continuum that begins early.”,
21650,Significant associations between TDV and negative outcomes were reported more frequently among females compared with males.,
21651,"In addition, the analyses showed some links between TDV and increased risk behaviours, as Piolanti explains, “We see that the majority of studies conclude TDV is associated with later cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use.”",
21652,"Also striking, he said, is the link to increased sexual risk behaviours, such as unprotected sex or intercourse under the influence of alcohol.",
21653,Associations with poorer mental health can also be found among those who report TDV in adolescence.,
21654,“The results of our study show that the long-term consequences of violence in teenage relationships can be serious.,
21655,"Prevention programmes are therefore very important, especially since they have already been able to prove in other studies that they are effective,” concludes Antonio Piolanti.

21656,"From the 9th to the 11th of May 2023, the ÖH elections for the upcoming two-year term of office will take place to determine the next study programme representatives, university representatives and federal representatives.",
21657,"Around 11,700 students are eligible to vote at the University of Klagenfurt.",
21658,The ÖH elections constitute the basis for student co-determination at universities.,
21659,"Hence this appeal: VOTE TODAY, SHAPE TOMORROW!  ",
21660,What is the Austrian Students’ Union (ÖH)?,
21661,The Austrian Students’ Union (ÖH) is the legal body representing the interests of all students and it holds statutory co-determination rights at universities.,
21662,"Upon being admitted to the university and paying the required membership fee, each and every student becomes a member of the ÖH.",
21663,"The ÖH’s principal task is to represent student interests when dealing with the teaching staff and the general public, and to provide information and services for students.",
21664,Who is eligible to vote?,
21665,"At the University of Klagenfurt, all students who have been admitted to a degree programme and/or who have registered to continue their studies in the summer semester of 2023 on or before the 21st of March 2023 have the right to vote.",
21666,Citizenship is not important in the ÖH elections.,
21667,This means that students from third countries or Erasmus students are also eligible to vote.,
21668,"According to the preliminary electoral roll, 11,762 students are eligible to vote at the University of Klagenfurt.",
21669,Who or what will be elected?,
21670,"In addition to the study programme representatives of the University of Klagenfurt (personal election) and the university representatives (list election, i.e. groups or parliamentary groups), students also directly elect the federal representatives (list election).",
21671,Three ballot papers will be issued to each student covering the three levels of representation.,
21672,How can students vote?,
21673,"On the election days from the 9th to the 11th May 2023, students can cast their vote directly at the polling station at the University of Klagenfurt.",
21674,"If students are not going to be at the university on the election days, they can apply for an absentee ballot at wahlportal.oeh.ac.at until the 2nd of May 2023.",
21675,"This application must be received by the postal voting commission (Taubstummengasse 7-9, 1040 Vienna) by the 10th of May 2023 at 6 pm at the latest.

21682,"“Originally, I decided to study Computer Science since it was a safe future option for me, compared for example to Mathematics.",
21683,"I wasn’t sure whether that would have been my path, but I knew that I would have found a good job with it even after graduating with a BA.",
21684,"However, the more I learned about it, the more the topic fascinated me, leading me to continue my studies”, she tells us.",
21685,Alice Tarzariol is currently completing her doctorate at the University of Klagenfurt.,
21686,Her research topic is situated in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning.,
21687,"“Logic programming has a huge potential for expressing in an elegant and simple way configuration problems, which industries address every day in their production phases”, she explains.",
21688,"“However, writing an efficient logic program is not an easy thing.",
21689,"For this reason, in my research I apply machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of existing programs exploiting hidden properties that are difficult to catch”.",
21690,"With the groundwork for her thesis firmly in place, Alice Tarzariol plans to use the remaining year to refine her work even further.",
21691,Some of her papers have already been published at top conferences and in high-ranking journals – such as the International Joint Conference of Artificial Intelligence and the Machine Learning Journal.,
21692,"Most recently, she received the Best Student Paper Award at the International Conference on Logic Programming in Haifa/Israel.",
21693,"Prior to embarking on her studies, Alice Tarzariol could not have imagined what the subject of Computer Science would have in store for her.",
21694,"“At my high school, the emphasis was mainly on the field of Economics.",
21695,"It was thanks to my Computer Science and Math teachers that I started to be interested in the topic; then, at the University, I got hooked on the subject and realized that Computer Science is more than programming, programming, programming”, says Alice Tarzariol, who was always very keen on the subject of Mathematics.",
21696,"In the meantime, she has landed where her talent can be put to best use – in the logic area of Computer Science.",
21697,"We ask her whether she ever found it a hindrance or indeed a benefit to be a woman studying in a field that – to this day – is dominated by men, and we are told: “I have heard of this being an issue, but in all honesty I can say: It did not and still does not have any significance for me.",
21698,I have never encountered any difference and I feel fully integrated.”,
21699,"Alice Tarzariol would ideally like to continue her academic career, even though this is the more difficult path and many details are unpredictable, especially due to short-term contracts.",
21700,“My heart tells me that I would like to continue this adventure.,
21701,"Partly, because I love to teach”, she emphasises.",
21702,"Industry, on the other hand, offers better security and plenty of opportunities for professional development.",
21703,"“So far, I have always been offered interesting positions.",
21704,"I trust that the right thing will come along again at the right time”, Alice Tarzariol remains confident.  ",
21705,What motivates you to work in science?,
21706,"It is fascinating to identify, formulate and try to solve new challenges every time, extending our current knowledge by discovering something entirely novel.",
21707,Do your parents understand what it is you are working on?,
21708,"Not really, but they always provide me fully support during my research and that’s the important thing to me.",
21709,What’s the first thing you do in the morning?,
21710,It depends on what there is on my to-do list.,
21711,"In general, I start with the task I feel least inclined to do.",
21712,"This approach has helped me to progress on my research, especially during tough time.",
21713,Do you have proper holidays?,
21714,Without thinking about your work?,
21715,"Yes, it is necessary for me to keep a fresh mind and try to solve problems using a different perspective.",
21716,What makes you furious?,
21717,"Dealing with unreasonable people, who are unwilling to understand others.",
21718,And what calms you down?,
21719,Having a walk in a quite area or spending time with my boyfriend.,
21720,What are you afraid of?,
21721,The uncertainty of the future.,
21722,What are you looking forward to?,
21723,"Tackling the next challenge.
",
21724,"Typically, drone flight data is generated under laboratory conditions – thus limiting its use for real-world application development.",
21725,"A team of researchers from Klagenfurt, working with two researchers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has now published the first large pool of real-world measurement data.",
21726,The data was generated in and around the Klagenfurt drone hall and in the context of the AMADEE20 Mars simulation in Israel.  ,
21727,"The potential uses of microhelicopters, or drones, are many.",
21728,"However, if drones are to explore disaster areas or deliver packages, they must be able to navigate safely in a variety of environments.",
21729,"In rainy, foggy or windy conditions, over textured or plain surfaces, gazing into the distance or traversing narrow canyons between high-rise buildings: It is not possible to fully replicate real-world conditions in laboratories.",
21730,"Christian Brommer, Alessandro Fornasier, Martin Scheiber, Jan Steinbrener and Stephan Weiss (all from the University of Klagenfurt), along with Jeff Delaune and Roland Brockers (JPL/NASA), have recently presented the so-called INSANE datasets.",
21731,"The datasets present different scenarios for localisation methods featuring varying degrees of difficulty: These include complex outdoor flights in desert conditions that resemble Mars, as well as flights that involve a drone entering a building from an outside area, which requires a switch in sensing modalities.",
21732,These flight manoeuvres in particular hold great interest for applications in the smart agriculture sector.,
21733,"Here, miniature helicopters record data from a field in the open air and autonomously fly to a covered area where they are recharged and transmit their data.",
21734,"To ensure that the team is able to collect the greatest possible volume of data, the helicopter is equipped with up to 18 sensors, three of which are high-resolution cameras for image-based navigation and 3D reconstructions.",
21735,"The data reveals a very precise localisation of the helicopters in the sub-degree and centimetre range, and the speed and vibration dynamics of the vehicle are also recorded.",
21736,Christian Brommer underlines the importance of this work for other research teams: “We provide the sensor data in the form of raw data together with the post-processing tools.,
21737,These findings serve as an important springboard for the development and expansion of novel fields of application.”,
21738,"The data pool will be continually expanded and can be accessed online at https://www.aau.at/en/smart-systems-technologies/control-of-networked-systems/datasets/ .
",
21739,The Department of Networked and Embedded Systems at the University of Klagenfurt is working with EU partner institutions to develop a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence for universities in Nigeria as part of an EU-funded “EmbeddedAI” project.  ,
21740,"For years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the top of the technology must-watch list for evolving trends and applications.",
21741,"With the ability to build smart machines that simulate human intelligence, the implications for technological advancement across numerous sectors are endless.",
21742,"Over the past several years, an important shift has occurred from cloud-level to device-level processing of artificial intelligence tasks, data and results.",
21743,Embedded AI is one direct consequence of the shift to edge computing.,
21744,Embedded Artificial Intelligence (AI) applies machine and deep learning in software at the device level.,
21745,"The use and application of embedded AI are vast, as seen in automating processes, providing advanced analytics and business insights, and improving customer service, among numerous other benefits.",
21746,"The application of Embedded AI cuts across several industries such as agriculture, aviation, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, shipping, and supply chain.",
21747,The embedded AI skillset is particularly useful for promoting entrepreneurship where young people are equipped with the complete competence to realise new products that utilise artificial intelligence as digitalisation is identified as the most extended and significant technological development in all sectors of the Nigerian economy.,
21748,"Embedded AI will allow Nigerian HEIs, industries, and entrepreneurs to utilise data to facilitate economic growth.  ",
21749,Project Map ‘EmbeddedAI’,
21750,"The overall objective of EmbeddedAI is to establish an international Master of Science program in the field of embedded Artificial Intelligence with key specialisation in embedded systems and a strong emphasis on industrial involvement, which includes application domains for agriculture, healthcare, telecommunication, and manufacturing.",
21751,"It includes establishing a corresponding curriculum with well-defined rules for admission, evaluation, teaching methodologies, certification awarding and accreditation.",
21752,"EmbeddedAI is designed to equip Nigerian students with the latest digital trends, improving employability and entrepreneurship.",
21753,"Also, EmbeddedAI will help Nigerian HEs engage with various EU HEs and cultural backgrounds to promote globalisation and technology growth based on their preferences and expectations.",
21754,"EmbeddedAI addresses unemployment and boosts international collaboration for the Nigerian universities (University of Port Harcourt (UPH), University of Abuja (UoA), Michael Okapra University of Agriculture Umudike (MOU), Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATB), and Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) ) with EU partner institutions University of Siegen (USI), Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH), Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt (AAU).",
21755,"In addition, EmbeddedAI aims to use AI and related technologies as an opportunity to create and reinforce diversity.",
21756,"The key to this will be to facilitate and promote the skills development of diverse people and make concerted efforts to level the playing field for women and other minorities in the industry.
",
21757,The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide.,
21758,"To date, there is no digital record of precisely where each machine is located or where a sprinkler system is suspended from the ceiling.",
21759,"As part of her doctoral thesis project, Christina Petschnigg headed to BMW in Munich to develop a methodology capable of implementing this digitalisation.",
21760,She has now completed her doctoral studies and is putting her expertise to good use at Infineon in Villach.  ,
21761,“A laser scanner records point clouds that map the layout of the plants.,
21762,"With the help of mathematical models, so-called deep neural networks, we were able to recognise objects and then derive a simulation model automatically.",
21763,"Ultimately, we ended up with a 3D model of a BMW factory“, Christina Petschnigg describes her work, which has involved living in Munich for the past three and a half years.",
21764,"The 3D models have many uses for production sites of this magnitude: If the factory is to be converted for the construction of a different car model, it is possible to simulate the conversion in advance and check whether it can be carried out efficiently.",
21765,It is also possible to optimise production processes on the basis of these models.,
21766,"A current weakness in this approach: At present, laser scanners have to be moved through the production halls manually and with great effort.",
21767,"“Right now, it takes a human being to generate the point clouds…",
21768,"But for the future I also asked myself: What conditions do we need within the factory so we can automate this step?”, she continues.",
21769,Christina Petschnigg was employed by BMW and supervised by Jürgen Pilz (Department of Statistics at the University of Klagenfurt).,
21770,"Subsequently, she moved to Villach, where she now works on supply chain digitalization at Infineon.",
21771,“What can we read from machines?,
21772,What are the stock levels?,
21773,How can these be tracked more efficiently?”.,
21774,These are the questions she is currently tackling.,
21775,Christina Petschnigg’s career path illustrates the diversity of the areas in which mathematics is applied.,
21776,She completed both the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in Technical Mathematics in Klagenfurt.,
21777,"“When I came to university, I had a different idea of what to expect.",
21778,"In the end, my studies were more abstract.",
21779,"At first, I did not expect the huge range of opportunities that this offers.",
21780,"From finance to civil engineering, from physics to computer science: the career options are many,” she tells us.",
21781,"What she likes most about mathematics is its logic: “Everything follows a logic, and nothing deviates from it.",
21782,There are no exceptions.,
21783,"Once I have grasped something, I no longer need to memorise things.",
21784,"What really matters is your interest: If you don’t have that, all you see are Greek letters.”",
21785,Christina Petschnigg was the first member of her family to pursue an academic education.,
21786,She was involved in research projects in the field of IT from early on.,
21787,"While completing her Master’s degree, she worked at Joanneum Research in the field of robotics.",
21788,"Her principal interest lies in the field of applied research, which is why she was keen to take up the offer of an industrial doctorate at BMW.",
21789,But “you only appreciate Carinthia once you have seen the disadvantages of a metropolis with millions of inhabitants.,
21790,"While you are still stuck in a traffic jam in Munich at 6 pm, you could already be enjoying a swim in a lake in Carinthia”, she concludes, having returned to Carinthia with international experience under her belt.  ",
21791,Did you have a plan B for your education and what might that have looked like?,
21792,"I didn’t really have a plan B, because I’ve always been interested in mathematics and physics.",
21793,Do your parents understand your work?,
21794,"Yes, they often ask me about my work and also have a general understanding of what I do.",
21795,What’s the first thing you do when you get to the office in the morning?,
21796,I check my e-mails and Outlook calendar to see what the day has in store for me.,
21797,Do you have proper holidays?,
21798,Without thinking about your work?,
21799,"Yes, it’s the only way I can really relax and recharge my batteries.",
21800,"Who do you regard as the greatest scientist in history, and why?",
21801,During my research I came across Katherine Johnson.,
21802,I consider her to be an outstanding personality.,
21803,"She was one of the first African-American women scientists at NASA and, among other things, she calculated the trajectory for Apollo 11’s moon mission.",
21804,We should bear in mind that access to higher education was particularly difficult for women and African-Americans at that time.,
21805,"Defying all odds, she received numerous awards for her outstanding scientific achievements.",
21806,What makes you furious?,
21807,Incomprehensible instruction manuals.,
21808,And what calms you down?,
21809,Extensive hikes and spending time at the lake.,
21810,Why do so many people fear mathematics?,
21811,I think mathematics can appear very abstract when you struggle to understand the underlying set of rules.,
21812,What are you looking forward to?,
21813,"Spending time with my family.
",
21814,Andreas Koppensteiner studied Applied Business Administration at the University of Klagenfurt.,
21815,"At first, he did not consider leaving Carinthia.",
21816,"Now, he has been living in France since 2001.",
21817,"In our interview, he explains why he decided to go abroad, why he changed his career after 20 years and what this new vocation means to him.  ",
21818,What did you study?,
21819,Applied Business Administration with a focus on Controlling and Strategic Management as well as Marketing and International Management.,
21820,Why did you choose the University of Klagenfurt?,
21821,"For purely practical reasons, actually.",
21822,At that time I was a committed Carinthian and did not want to move to Vienna or Graz.,
21823,"Besides, a move would also have meant missing out on my hobby, show jumping.",
21824,My horse was stabled with my trainer in Sankt Veit.,
21825,I only learned to appreciate the advantages of my alma mater minimunda during my time at university.,
21826,"One memorable experience during my time as a student was … life in the student village, revising for exams at the lido, the university parties and joining the theatre group as well as the excursions of the Department of Romance Studies.",
21827,"When I think of the University of Klagenfurt, I immediately think of … the university cafeteria, the centre of social life during my time at university.",
21828,That’s where I understood how to network.,
21829,Is there anything that still connects you to the University of Klagenfurt today?,
21830,"Yes, the wonderful memories.",
21831,Did you spend time abroad?,
21832,"Yes, and I have been living in France since January 2001.",
21833,How did those experiences shape you?,
21834,I completed my compulsory internship in Kassel (Germany) as part of my studies.,
21835,"Over the course of these six months, I became aware that it is also possible to live outside of Carinthia.",
21836,"When I returned to Carinthia, I was ready for a new experience abroad.",
21837,It was clear that I wanted to go “somewhere else” after finishing my studies.,
21838,"The start was the Tyrolean lowlands, but the mountains limited my horizons too much.",
21839,"And so, after 15 months, I said goodbye and headed for France.",
21840,This was originally for a two-year internal “secondment” to a newly acquired production site of my employer at the time.,
21841,The rest is history… Do you have any tips for todays students wishing to go abroad?,
21842,"Make sure to take advantage of all the offers, there are many programmes for trips within Europe or even beyond.",
21843,"And most of the time, as a student, you are still unattached and flexible.",
21844,"Everyone knows the saying about looking beyond the garden fence, I can only confirm that.",
21845,"The longer you stay abroad, the better, because you will “immerse” yourself in a new culture after a certain point.",
21846,"And usually there’s a language barrier at the beginning, which you have to overcome first.",
21847,"But once you start thinking in another language, swearing, expressing your feelings and dreaming, then you’ve mastered it.",
21848,How did you end up in your current job/activity?,
21849,How did your career develop?,
21850,"After graduating in Applied Business Administration, I worked in various positions in industry for almost 20 years (Head of Operational Controlling, Commercial Manager, etc.).Somewhere along the line, however, it wasn’t fun any more, the motivation dropped by the wayside.",
21851,"So I decided to refocus professionally, invested a year in a university course and have recently graduated.",
21852,"Fortunately, I was also able to find a job in my new field right away.",
21853,I recently took over the management of a retirement and nursing home in the centre of Strasbourg.,
21854,What are your duties at work?,
21855,What does your daily professional life look like?,
21856,I am responsible for 60 residents and 60 staff members.,
21857,"I am entrusted with the relations with the families or the persons responsible for my residents, I take care of compliance with the regulations prescribed by law, I pay attention to hygiene, etc.",
21858,I am also in charge of the care of the residents.,
21859,"A very versatile field of work, extremely exciting and varied.",
21860,It never gets boring.,
21861,What is it about your job that you particularly appreciate?,
21862,"It is precisely this variety, but above all the feeling of being able to contribute to the well-being of the residents.",
21863,At last I have a reason to get up early in the morning again.,
21864,Did your studies prepare you for your current job?,
21865,"Of course, I brought a lot of knowledge with me from my education.",
21866,And I acquired others during my first career.,
21867,How do you define success?,
21868,"Nowadays, I tend to define myself in terms of contentment.",
21869,Do you have a (life) motto?,
21870,Treat everyone as you would like to be treated.,
21871,What advice would you give to today’s students?,
21872,Gain practical experience as soon as possible.,
21873,Complete internships.,
21874,What do you do to balance your professional life?,
21875,"I cycle a lot, explore the surroundings and I still ride.",
21876,What challenges do you find most appealing?,
21877,Those with realistic goals and respectful interactions.,
21878,A few words with Andreas Koppensteiner,
21879,A happy moment at the University of Klagenfurt was… my graduation.,
21880,From my student days I still have… lots of memories and my best friend.,
21881,Who inspired you?,
21882,The environment around me.,
21883,"If I were to study again, I would… I completed a second degree in January 2022, this time in France.",
21884,I wanted to change professionally.,
21885,"My university experience in 4 words: Student village, lido, Mensa building and the internet.",
21886,"Andreas Koppensteiner is a Carinthian of the world.
",
21887,"Markus Hornböck, one of our graduates, studied Applied Business Administration.",
21888,He has served as Managing Director of BABEG Kärntner Betriebsansiedlungs- und Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H. since 2019.,
21889,"In this interview, he tells us about the importance of the university for Carinthia as a business location, taking time to reflect and upcoming projects.  ",
21890,"Mr. Hornböck, you studied Applied Business Administration.",
21891,What areas of specialisation did you choose?,
21892,"The specialisations I focused on were financing, banking and loans, public business administration and innovation management.",
21893,Did you already have a career goal in mind back then?,
21894,"At the time, my professional ambitions were still vague, but I did know that I wanted to work on projects where I could make a difference, and that was also what drove me to choose Business Administration.",
21895,Why did you choose the University of Klagenfurt?,
21896,I was working in Klagenfurt at the time and helping out in my local forestry company.,
21897,"Even then, what was decisive for me was the friendly atmosphere at the University of Klagenfurt.",
21898,The high quality of student supervision at the University of Klagenfurt represents a unique selling point that very few universities can offer.,
21899,One unforgettable memory from my student days is… putting together my first timetable.,
21900,"That was definitely very challenging for me, but later it proved to be fun.",
21901,"When I think of the University of Klagenfurt, I immediately think of… the symbiosis between the University of Klagenfurt and Lakeside Park.",
21902,I look forward to its continued development.,
21903,Do you still have a connection to the university?,
21904,"Yes, whenever we design projects, we always take the university into account.",
21905,It is an integral part of our projects.,
21906,It is impossible to think of the location without the university.,
21907,The university is very appealing.,
21908,"As BABEG, it is our job to continue to develop the region, and we can only do that by having a university here.",
21909,Did you spend any time abroad?,
21910,I was able to expand my language skills by spending time in Slovenia during my studies.,
21911,"After graduating, I worked in Europe for a long time.",
21912,I see a period spent abroad as an essential building block in my personal development.,
21913,The University of Klagenfurt offers a wide range of opportunities in this regard.,
21914,One simply has to make use of them.,
21915,Do you have any tips for present-day students who want to go abroad?,
21916,"Each of us should go abroad in the short or medium term, because it is very formative for our perspective.",
21917,"At the same time, making sure that people also return is essential for our location.",
21918,This is becoming easier and easier to achieve because our location is so compelling.,
21919,How has your career evolved?,
21920,"In 2008, after finishing my studies, I started working for Pago, where I was responsible for purchasing.",
21921,In 2011 I moved to the APS Group.,
21922,This company specialises in headhunting.,
21923,"While I was there, I built up a new division of my own and was also responsible for Carinthia.",
21924,"In 2013, my professional path led me to the political office of the State of Carinthia.",
21925,"In this position, I was responsible for research and development, equity investments, and the labour market.",
21926,This taught me how to chart a strategic course for the ongoing development of Carinthia as a business location.,
21927,"In 2019, I applied for the position I have today and was appointed.",
21928,I have been the Managing Director of BABEG for four years now.,
21929,I worked in different countries for my previous employers and each position taught me something useful for my current job.,
21930,I would advise today’s students to take time to reflect between jobs in order to continue to evolve.,
21931,My generation tends to be shaped by the idea that you have a job and keep it until you retire.,
21932,Today’s generation has understood that taking time for oneself is a good thing.,
21933,It is essential to make use of this time.,
21934,Do you have a favourite project at BABEG?,
21935,"There are so many great projects revolving around the 5G Playground, the Digital Innovation Hub, the energy transition, research, business location, location development and strategic investments.",
21936,"A lot of heart and soul currently lies in the continued development of our science and technology parks, such as Lakeside Park, High Tech Campus Villach and the “Campus 2050” project.",
21937,"This is where we can demonstrate our strengths and address the issues of decarbonisation, climate and energy efficiency and implement solutions.",
21938,What are your professional duties?,
21939,What does your daily routine look like?,
21940,Variety defines my daily life and keeps the job exciting.,
21941,I perform many different activities.,
21942,"This involves strategies, HR and organisational development, but I also have to act as a trouble shooter.",
21943,"My university education taught me a lot with regard to the former, and my own experience has benefited me with regard to the latter.",
21944,"First and foremost, my work is about developing strategies and projects and aligning societies so that the internal workings are such that minimal influence is required on my part.",
21945,This frees me up to develop projects.,
21946,"That said, my responsibilities extend beyond the confines of BABEG.",
21947,"I am actively involved in other companies, on supervisory boards and boards of directors, and they all act in synergy.",
21948,Did your university studies equip you for your current job?,
21949,"Yes, the degree provided me with the tools for many areas.",
21950,The ability to work autonomously is an important asset which we gain from attending university.,
21951,It is also what shapes the mindset of the students.,
21952,"Nothing can replace practical experience, but that is also not the duty of a university.",
21953,"Having said that, the University of Klagenfurt – and I would like to emphasise this – does a lot, for example with its exemplary role regarding practical semesters.",
21954,What are Carinthia’s strengths as a location?,
21955,What role does BABEG play here?,
21956,This is something we make every effort to express succinctly.,
21957,It would be simplistic to say that we are the location that other people choose for their holidays.,
21958,I believe that we also have the advantage of being a high-tech industrial location.,
21959,"This is sometimes underestimated, but it is nevertheless true.",
21960,"Besides the job, we have to be able to present everything else in the best possible way: Private life including housing, childcare, education, etc.",
21961,"The point is not only the beauty of a location, but also lowering barriers to education, research, cooperation partners and entrepreneurship.",
21962,"To this end, we turn soft facts into hard facts.",
21963,How would you define success?,
21964,"For me, success is about having the opportunity to put my ideas into practice.",
21965,Do you have a (life) motto?,
21966,Actively shape the future.,
21967,What advice would you give to the students of today?,
21968,The nurturing environment provided by Carinthia is not vast.,
21969,"It is important to build up friendships during your time at university, thereby ensuring that cooperative ventures work more effectively.",
21970,What do you do to find balance in your life?,
21971,"I spend my spare time with my children, from skiing to going to Jump World.",
21972,I also like visiting the forest and I run my grandparents’ forestry business.,
21973,What challenges excite you most?,
21974,Everything that entails complexity.,
21975,"No low hanging fruits.
",
21976,Many of those following the current media discourse are left with a sense of alarmism: The message seems to be that advances being made in the development of artificial intelligence could cause the systems to spiral out of control.,
21977,"At the same time, experts are voicing concern about the potential influence of these technologies on the stability of democracies, given that images can be manipulated in a matter of seconds.",
21978,"We asked Wolfgang Faber, professor at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, for his take on the new AI tools and the state of research.  ",
21979,AI technologies are currently omnipresent in the media.,
21980,Why do you think this is the case?,
21981,The term has been in use since the 1950s and the basic notion that machines might think or act in a manner that resembles human beings has been around for much longer.,
21982,"At present, we are witnessing breakthroughs in the proliferation of these technologies.",
21983,They are more readily available today.,
21984,"Anyone can download image manipulation software, chat with a bot or use AI technology to complete their homework.",
21985,"While much of this was possible in the past, it wasn’t widely known.",
21986,"More than 1,000 people, including Elon Musk, recently called for a freeze on the development of AI technologies.",
21987,What is your view on this?,
21988,I find the move hard to follow.,
21989,"Even if you wanted to introduce this kind of pause for reflection, it’s unclear how it would be enforced.",
21990,"Of course, you can stop funding, but I really don’t see the point in doing that either.",
21991,"Thinking about recent AI technology developments, what surprises you most?",
21992,I am amazed that the natural language used by a bot like ChatGPT feels so authentic.,
21993,It’s truly remarkable.,
21994,Speech recognition has long been a major weakness in the field; now we can see it working well.,
21995,What astonishes me even more is how easily we humans are persuaded by content that is generated by a machine.,
21996,What is the alleged threat of artificial intelligence – the machine that is capable of something that seems uncanny or the human being who is unable to fully comprehend it?,
21997,"I think the danger lies in the way the technology is used, in the pragmatics of it.",
21998,Let’s consider the example of image manipulation:,
21999,This is not new.,
22000,"In the past, it took longer and required a fair amount of skill and patience to manipulate an image.",
22001,"Today, the process is significantly faster.",
22002,Technology is more readily available and therefore more likely to present a danger when used irresponsibly.,
22003,"Here, we need ethical systems of regulation.",
22004,"Time and again, it is also reported that the underlying mechanisms of artificial intelligence are poorly understood.",
22005,"I don’t believe that is a danger, since many motorists do not understand what is going on under the bonnet of their car from a technical point of view.",
22006,I’m sure that’s not an issue.,
22007,But at least the people who build cars understand how they work.,
22008,I find that reassuring.,
22009,The engineers who build AI also know what’s going on in terms of technology.,
22010,And things haven’t yet taken on a life of their own.,
22011,"The idea that at some point in the future AI will design other AI that is even more advanced, seems inconceivable at present.",
22012,I see no immediate danger there.,
22013,Your own research lies in the field of artificial intelligence.,
22014,What questions are you particularly interested in?,
22015,We are attempting to determine what knowledge is and how we as humans develop intelligence.,
22016,A closer look reveals that the very definition of intelligence is fraught with difficulty.,
22017,Our assumption is that it is a collection of various skills.,
22018,"In the field of AI, we are discovering that it is a tough challenge to reconcile these different aspects.",
22019,And what is knowledge?,
22020,Knowledge is also a skill.,
22021,"When we know something, we can weigh our actions in advance and adjust them to do what our knowledge guides us to do.",
22022,My work deals with understanding how knowledge is represented and how conclusions are drawn.,
22023,Knowledge is also linked to learning.,
22024,"Indeed, but that is not among my core areas of focus.",
22025,"However, learning from AI systems currently features very prominently in the media.",
22026,"We can observe interesting phenomena here, because learning also works in very different ways: How do children learn to ride a bicycle and how do we learn to tell edible mushrooms from other fungi?",
22027,"The former is learned through experience, but the latter is best not learned in the same way.",
22028,So how do AI learning systems learn?,
22029,"We can use the much-cited example of the chihuahua vs. the blueberry muffin: There are some photos where it is difficult to distinguish the dog from the sweet treat, even for the human brain.",
22030,"We do eventually get it right, but we don’t understand how we are able to do it.",
22031,It is all the more difficult for a technology to learn this distinction.,
22032,Is it possible to measure whether a system (or a person) has understood something?,
22033,It is very difficult.,
22034,"We are all familiar with that feeling when things suddenly become clear to us, when the proverbial penny drops.",
22035,"Even with my own students, I am not always sure whether I can tell for certain that someone has really understood something.",
22036,"Applying this to AI technologies, many problems will remain unresolved until we fully comprehend what understanding is.",
22037,Do you feel that ChatGPT understands you?,
22038,Not really.,
22039,(Wolfgang Faber shares a chat history with ChatGPT on the following question: Jimmy lives in a house with his two brothers and his parents.,
22040,How many people are in Jimmy’s family?,
22041,see insert),
22042,Faber: Jimmy lives in a house with his two brothers and his parents.,
22043,How many people are in Jimmy’s family?,
22044,"ChatGPT: There are a total of six people in Jimmy’s family, including himself, his two brothers, and his parents.",
22045,Faber: Why six people?,
22046,ChatGPT: There are six people in Jimmy’s family because Jimmy has two brothers and his parents.,
22047,"Including Jimmy, that makes a total of six people in the family.",
22048,Faber: I don’t understand why 6.,
22049,ChatGPT: I apologize for the confusion earlier.,
22050,"I assumed that Jimmy had two brothers and his parents, but since the prompt does not provide that information, it’s best to be more general.",
22051,"In general, a family can have any number of members, depending on their individual circumstances.",
22052,"For example, a family may consist of a single parent and a child, two parents and multiple children, grandparents living with their adult children and grandchildren, and so on.",
22053,"Therefore, without additional information about the size of Jimmy’s family, I cannot give you a specific number.",
22054,"However, I hope this explanation helps.",
22055,Faber:,
22056,"The prompt does say two brothers and parents, and you can assume that there are two parents.",
22057,So how many people are there?,
22058,ChatGPT: I apologize for my earlier confusion.,
22059,"Based on the information provided in the prompt, Jimmy lives in a house with his two brothers and his parents.",
22060,"Therefore, there are a total of five people in Jimmy’s family, including himself, his two brothers, and his parents.",
22061,Faber: Why did you say 6 people before?,
22062,ChatGPT: I apologize for my earlier mistake.,
22063,"I misunderstood the prompt and assumed that Jimmy had two brothers, in addition to his parents.",
22064,"However, the prompt clearly states that he lives with his two brothers and his parents.",
22065,"Therefore, there are five people in Jimmy’s family, including himself, his two brothers, and his parents.",
22066,Faber: I do not see a contradiction to your assumption.,
22067,"ChatGPT: You are correct that there is no explicit contradiction in assuming that Jimmy has two brothers and two parents, as this is a common family structure.",
22068,"However, it is important to clarify the information provided in the prompt to avoid any misunderstandings.",
22069,"Given that the prompt states that Jimmy lives with his two brothers and his parents, it is safest to assume that there are only two parents in the family, as this is the most common family structure.",
22070,"Therefore, there are five people in Jimmy’s family, including himself, his two brothers, and his two parents.",
22071,"I hope this clears up any confusion, and I apologize for any earlier mistakes.",
22072,"Some years ago, there was news coverage of an AI programme that was supposed to be able to pass school tests set for 8th graders in the US.",
22073,I tried a simple question that even 5-year-olds can solve.,
22074,"Here, too, we can see that the programme can express itself impressively and accurately in grammatical terms.",
22075,"However, as far as the content is concerned, the answers do not always make sense.",
22076,It is also a fascinating experiment to ask this kind of programme about oneself.,
22077,"When I ask the question “Who is Wolfgang Faber?”, the result is a CV that is similar to mine, but contains numerous errors.",
22078,"In other words, one of the weaknesses inherent to such systems is the underlying data and the notion of time: What is present?",
22079,What is past?,
22080,Can you distinguish a term paper written using ChatGPT from self-penned work?,
22081,I do not presume to claim that I would get this right every time.,
22082,"Obvious inconsistencies are easily identified, of course, but I am not sure that coherent texts would be identified with similar ease.",
22083,"Besides, there is a chance that much of this will improve considerably in the near future.",
22084,"A study commissioned by a bank recently found that journalists and writers, among others, belong to professions that are under threat from emerging AI technologies.",
22085,"Yet both require originality at the very least, and maybe even a sense of humour.",
22086,Is this something AI can excel at?,
22087,"Determining whether a joke is funny or not, and what type of humour appeals to whom, is very complicated.",
22088,I don’t know if AI can tell good jokes.,
22089,I’ve never tested that.,
22090,"In journalism, I can imagine that a piece of AI technology might do a good job condensing lengthy texts to brief summaries.",
22091,"But, to be honest, that is the boring part of journalism.",
22092,"When it comes to exciting tasks, for example carrying out an investigation, I have no idea how this might work from a technical point of view.",
22093,I don’t think that earning a livelihood as an author might be jeopardised.,
22094,What approaches is AI research taking in the development of new technologies?,
22095,"One approach is based on the assumption that we need to build something resembling a brain, which then also operates in a similar way to the human brain.",
22096,"The corresponding projects are highly complex, and much of what we expect from the result is still rather obscure: Do we really know all we need to know about the human brain in order to build something that is brain-like?",
22097,"Then, what happens once we have built a technical brain?",
22098,Will it think?,
22099,"And if so, how do we ascertain that?",
22100,The other view takes a more bottom-up approach and considers specific problems for which researchers hope to find better solutions with the aid of artificial intelligence.,
22101,We believe that it would be expedient to link the two strategies more tightly to each other.,
22102,What skills do you teach your children to prepare them for a world where AI features more prominently?,
22103,It is important that they get to experience these technologies in practice.,
22104,Shielding people only makes the ‘forbidden’ thing seem even more appealing.,
22105,It vital to have a conversation about how these technologies work.,
22106,"At the same time, we can jointly examine the advantages and disadvantages of using them.",
22107,And we mustn’t forget: What it is that a technology cannot do?,
22108,"In research in particular, this is often the most fascinating question.  ",

",
22113,Anti-Semitism and German Nationalism were already rampant among members of the University of Vienna before National Socialism came to power in Austria in March 1938.,
22114,"The early history of academic anti-Semitism at the University of Vienna was marked by the so-called “Vienna Gesera”, the systematic destruction of the Jewish communities in the duchy of Austria in 1421.",
22115,"Duke Albert V had Jews arrested in 1420 and over the course of a few months drove them out of Austria under accusations of collaboration with Hussites, stories of ritual murder and host desecration.",
22116,"All Jews left in Vienna – more than 200 – were sentenced to death on March 12, 1421, and brutally executed by burning on the same day at the Gänseweide in Erdberg.",
22117,The University of Vienna profited from the pogrom in 1420/21: the stones from the destroyed synagogue were used to build a new faculty building (Nova Structura).,
22118,"Today, a memorial plaque in Erdberg (Kegelgasse 40) commemorates the Vienna Gesera.",
22119,"In the middle of the 16th century, Antonius Margaritha (from 1533 until his death in 1542) and later Paulus Weidner (ca. 1560-1585) – both having converted from Judaism to Catholicism – were the first to teach Hebrew at the University of Vienna.",
22120,They also acted as political advisors to the monarchy in regard to anti-Jewish measures.,
22121,Weidner furthermore gained influence at court as personal physician to the Emperor and at the university as dean and rector.,
22122,"Under Emperor Leopold I, another wave of reprisals against the Viennese Jews took place, which ended with their expulsion in 1670.",
22123,Vienna University students were substantially involved in anti-Jewish riots.,
22124,The Patent of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II in 1782 improved Austrian Jews’ legal status and laid the foundation for the admission of Jewish students to the “worldly” faculties of the University of Vienna.,
22125,"Joseph von Sonnenfels, an ennobled Jewish convert, influenced the legislation of Joseph II in general and studies at the University of Vienna in particular as a lawyer, as professor of police science and Cameralism (political science) and as rector of the University of Vienna.",
22126,"After the revolution of 1848/49, Jews received equal status as citizens and recognition as a religious community with the Staatsgrundgesetz (basic law) of 1867.",
22127,"The revolution, however, also established the basis for the foundation of numerous fraternities and other students associations , many of which drifted towards German National and anti-Semitic ideologies over the course of the 19th century, leading to a lasting politicization at the University of Vienna.",
22128,Many prominent professors – among them the famous surgeon Theodor Billroth – publically stepped out with anti-Semitic remarks.,
22129,In the first decades of the 20th century German National and Catholic National teachers increasingly organized themselves against their Jewish competition and oftentimes prevented them from receiving positions at the university.,
22130,"The “Deutscher Klub” (“German Club”) and the „Bärenhöhle“, (“Bear’s Den”) are examples of these organizations, which were particularly active in the interwar period as anti-Semitic networks within the university.",
22131,"Since the 1920s violent attacks by German National and National Socialist students against Jewish and socialist classmates increased, particularly at the Institute of Anatomy under Julius Tandler, or on the occasion of the abolishment of the anti-Semitic Gleispach student regulation 1930.",
22132,"When Austrofascism came into power, anti-Semitism was still commonplace at the University of Vienna.",
22133,"This manifested itself in several riots by National Socialist students, but in particular also in the public discussion about the murder of philosopher Moritz Schlick in the university’s Main Building in 1936.",
22134,"Finally, in 1938, the anti-Semitic tendencies culminated in the complete and systematic expulsion of Jewish teachers and students from the University of Vienna after Austria’s “Anschluss” to the National Socialist German Reich.",
22135,More than 2500 university members classified as “Jewish” were removed from the university and were subsequently subject to further persecution up to the extermination in the system of concentration camps.,
22136,"After the end of the Second World War, “reconstruction” overcast the issue of dealing with the university’s involvement in National Socialism.",
22137,"Due to efforts to swiftly resume normal operations at the University of Vienna, denazification of teachers and students was not conducted very consequently.",
22138,"In contrast, expelled Jewish scientists who had fled abroad were often not reintegrated.",
22139,"Slowly even exposed National Socialists were allowed to return to their former positions at the university, which became very clear two decades later in the scandal surrounding the open anti-Semitism of Taras Borodajkewycz, a professor of economic history at the Vienna University of Economics and lecturer at the University of Vienna.",
22140,"The death of Ernst Kirchweger, a former communist resistance fighter, received international attention when he was assaulted by a neo-Nazi during a large demonstration against Borodajkewycz and died several days later as a result of his injuries.",
22141,In the 1980s a discourse about its role in National Socialism and anti-Semitism developed at the University of Vienna.,
22142,"Apart from numerous research projects, the university’s new reflected approach towards its involvement was for example expressed in the historical and artistic contextualization of the German National “Siegfriedskopf” monument in the University Main Building in 2006.",
22143,Despite various studies many questions remain unanswered in this context.,
22144,"These include contemporary historical aspects that for example concern anti-Semitic structures and networks at the university before 1938, or the Catholic-theological faculty’s involvement in the Gesera in 1420/21, which is currently being investigated in a research project at the faculty.
",
22145,"The University of Vienna not only is one of the oldest north of the Alps and east of the Rhine, from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 16th century it also had the highest number of students in this area.",
22146,"Current university statistics reveal, among other things, the national or regional origin of their students, with an international composition being seen a sign for a high attraction and thus for high quality of the university.",
22147,How was this handled in the Middle Ages?,
22148,Did the university even record the origin of their students?,
22149,Are regional focuses noticeable and did these change over time?,
22150,The University of Vienna – like other medieval universities as well – in general had no regional restrictions on the admission of students.,
22151,"The universitas magistrorum et scholarium, the community of teachers and students, was open to all Christian men born in wedlock.",
22152,Despite this general openness each university of course had regional focuses in regards to the composition of their students.,
22153,"The second university in Central Europe The University of Vienna was founded in 1365 and was, after the University of Prague (founded in 1347), only the second university in Central Europe to be continuously operational.",
22154,"Close to this – both geographically and temporally – universities were also established in Cracow (1364) and in Pécs (1367), but both of these were completely or at least partially disbanded within a few years of their opening.",
22155,"In the 1380s a first wave of university foundations swept over the area of the Holy Roman Empire, followed by two more at the beginning and middle of the 15th century.",
22156,Due to Vienna’s head start it was able to establish itself as an important university for students from the empire.,
22157,Matriculation by academic nations The entries in the Viennese rector’s register (Matrikel) paint a rough picture of the regional composition of the university attendees.,
22158,The people listed were divided into academic nations.,
22159,"Classifying students into regional entities and calling these units nations was common practice at the universities, as is already pointed out in the founding letter of 1365.",
22160,There were differences in the number and designation of these nations.,
22161,"In Vienna there were four nations: the Austrian nation included people from the Austrian hereditary lands (Erbländer) as well as from Aquileia, Churwalchen and Italy.",
22162,"The Rhenish nation covered the South and the West of the empire, while university members from the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen, as well as from Bohemia, Moravia and the Greek area belonged to the Hungarian nation.",
22163,"The Saxon nation, finally, included – apart from the eponymous Saxons – people from the British Isles and Scandinavia.",
22164,Vienna – an attraction for students from Southern and Western Germany as well as from Austria The division by nations in the main register began in 1385.,
22165,"From that year until 1519 a total of 49,745 persons were entered into the register.",
22166,"The Rhenish and the Austrian nation formed the two largest groups with 45% (22,056 persons) and 34% (16,398 persons) respectively.",
22167,"The Hungarian and the Saxon nation lagged behind with 18% (8,743 persons) and 3% (1,405 persons) respectively.",
22168,Particularly from the matriculations of members of the Rhenish nation one can deduce changes in the university landscape of the empire.,
22169,Until 1450 there were no universities in Southern and Southwestern Germany.,
22170,Apart from Vienna there were only a few other universities in the empire:,
22171,"Erfurt (founded 1379), Heidelberg (1385), Cologne (1388), Leipzig (1409) and Rostock (1419).",
22172,"With the exception of Heidelberg, all of these universities were located in Northern and Northwestern Germany.",
22173,"Accordingly, a high influx of students from the Rhenish nation can be noted for this time: Almost half of all students, 49% (9,061 persons) belonged to it.",
22174,"The Austrian nation, the second largest group, counted only 24% of students (4,478 persons), half the number of the Rhenish nation, as its members.",
22175,"The Hungarian nation had about the same number of members, 22% (4,141 persons), while the Saxons came in last with only 5% of students (994 persons).",
22176,From the middle of the 15th century more and more universities were founded in Southern Germany.,
22177,"Students from this area could now also attend the universities in Freiburg im Breisgau (1457), Basel (1459), Ingolstadt (1459) or Tübingen (1476).",
22178,"This wider range of university locations is reflected in the changed composition of the Viennese student body: the Rhenish and the Austrian nation were now equally large with 44% (12,260 persons) and 40% (11,530 persons)",
22179,"respectively, while the percentage of Hungarians remained more or less the same with 15% (4,474 persons).",
22180,"The number of Saxons fell to 1% (394 persons), which can be traced back to the establishment of universities in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and the British Isles.",
22181,"The university register as a reflection of current events Not only the changes in the European university landscape, but also (more short-term) political or other events left their marks in the frequency of matriculations.",
22182,"Between 1461 and 1463 the matriculations of students from the Austrian nation dropped drastically, while no significant changes can be seen among members of the other nations.",
22183,This drop in Austrians is a result of a dispute between Frederick III and his brother Albert VI over the allocation of the Austrian lands.,
22184,"The altercations between Frederick and the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus are also reflected in short-term frequency changes, this time in the Hungarian nation: During the siege of Vienna 1477 the matriculation numbers declined in general, but especially among members of the Hungarian nation.",
22185,"When Matthias had relocated his residency to Vienna after its capture in 1485, the matriculation numbers of Hungarian students remained relatively stable, but after the king’s death in 1490 they again dropped for a short time.",
22186,Few Viennese among the university attendees,
22187,"Although the members of the Austrian nation formed the second largest group of university attendees in the Middle Ages, Viennese students were a minority.",
22188,Until 1519 only 1.73% (841 persons) of all matriculated students came from the city itself.,
22189,One can only speculate about the reasons for the university’s low attraction for the city’s population.,
22190,"One reason certainly was that the university and its members were considered somewhat of a foreign body in the city: They had their own judicial system independent of that of the city and were entitled to other privileges, such as exemptions from customs and taxes.",
22191,"Even though the “priest city” (“Pfaffenstadt”) planned by Rudolf IV – a city within the city separated by a wall – never was realized, a university neighborhood at the Stubentor emerged in the Middle Ages.",
22192,"The close proximity of the city’s inhabitants and the university members, who made up about 10% of the total population of medieval Vienna, repeatedly led to conflicts which were resolved in various ways.",
22193,"Some were decided in court, where the legitimacy of privileges was discussed, but some were decided in violent altercations between students and city residents.",
22194,"For some Viennese, this constant readiness for conflict might have been an argument against joining the university.",
22195,"This changed drastically in the 16th century: The percentage of Viennese students rose steadily, until they formed the majority of the matriculations.",
22196,"However, this is also a result of the matriculation numbers dropping dramatically from the 1520s onwards, which almost threatened the university’s existence.
",
22197,How did a student live in the Middle Ages?,
22198,Was finding appropriate housing his private matter or did the university have influence on student accommodations?,
22199,"Because the university understood itself as a “community of teachers and students”, its regulations not only encompassed the areas of teaching and learning, but also its members’ lifestyle.",
22200,This also affected the oversight of student housing.,
22201,"By today’s standards the supervision was rather strict – not surprising, since the average age of the majority of students was equivalent to that of a high school student today.",
22202,"The goal set by the university was to have all students live under the control of a magister, which never actually was implemented.",
22203,"Still, a large part of the student body lived in student housing controlled by the university, the so-called bursae.",
22204,Poor students had the option of living in student alms houses called coderies.,
22205,"Since most students at the University of Vienna came from outside of the city, they were faced with the problem of finding accommodations.",
22206,We can deduce from the medieval matriculation numbers that the students represented about 8 - 10 % of the city’s total population.,
22207,"Thus, providing student quarters and in particular supervising them were important issues for the university administration.",
22208,"The university tried to keep the student housing under their control as much as possible, particularly due to the students’ young age.",
22209,"In its statutes from 1389, the Faculty of Arts decreed that all students should live and study under the supervision of a magister.",
22210,"This decree was apparently never completely fulfilled, since in 1413 rules were set for those students who lived “privately” – in shared apartments or as servants of citizens.",
22211,They were contrasted with the bursa residents.  ,
22212,"The first bursae were privately led institutions: A magister – most often from the Faculty of Arts – offered quarters, meals and lessons for a weekly fee (the bursa, from which the name of this type of student housing was derived).",
22213,"He was responsible to the university for supervising the students, but he also was dependent on them as paying customers, which led to the university complaining about lax discipline in the bursae.",
22214,"These student accommodations were subject to the laws of supply and demand, meaning that many bursae only existed for a short while in times of high student numbers.",
22215,"Next to these, another type of bursae developed:",
22216,"Those financed through private foundations, which thus were less susceptible to economic fluctuations.",
22217,"The heads of these bursae (called conventors in the Middle Ages, and later superintendents) also were more independent from the students because these no longer were the direct source of money, but themselves were dependent on the payment of the scholarships.",
22218,"Due to this, the heads of the “foundation bursae” could more easily enforce disciplinary rules as opposed to those of the “entrepreneurial bursae”.  ",
22219,"Life in a bursa was governed by a strict set of rules, just like in the university itself.",
22220,"The statutes of early “entrepreneurial bursae” are not recorded, even though they most certainly existed.",
22221,"The most famous bursa statutes are those of the Rosenburse, written by Thomas Ebendorfer von Haselbach in 1432.",
22222,They served as an example for other bursae.,
22223,New members of the bursa had to take an oath to uphold these statutes.,
22224,The rules governed subjects such as collective and individual religious duties or communal meals.,
22225,These in particular made up an important part of the daily life: They were supposed to foster social cohesion among the residents of the bursa.,
22226,They also gave an opportunity to have intellectual discussions in Latin – exclusive use of this language was also regulated in the statutes.,
22227,The number of lectures one was supposed to visit depended on the rules of the bursa.,
22228,"Apart from this, practice dispositions were also offered in the student houses.",
22229,"Visiting “disreputable” places, such as taverns or brothels, was of course forbidden, as was contact with women, which is why the presence of women in the bursa was completely prohibited and punished severely.  ",
22230,"Bursae – even foundation bursae – were not primarily meant for poor students, even though it said in the entry regulations of some foundation bursae that they were dedicated to “the poor”.",
22231,They were mainly meant for the benefactor’s family members or for students from their home cities or regions.,
22232,"Since Vienna was one of the universities most frequented by pauperes, dedicated student accommodations were set up for them.",
22233,"In these so-called coderies, officially recognized poor students could live for a lower rent than in the bursae.",
22234,The originally Middle High German word “kote” meant a humble hut (the word “Kotter” developed from this) and was used by the students in the Latinized version “codria”.,
22235,"Similar to the bursae, the coderies were supervised by a conventor who usually was appointed by the Faculty of Arts.",
22236,"In principle, life in the coderies was also regulated by rules, but the students living here usually did not receive lessons.",
22237,They earned their keep by begging or singing in the city.,
22238,"Apparently, the coderies had less strict rules than the bursae, because the faculty of arts (who actually were responsible for the supervision) repeatedly complained that many well-off students lived in the coderies, because they preferred these alms houses to the bursae “due to the greater freedom”.  ",
22239,"In the course of the university reforms under Ferdinand I, a large part of the bursae and coderies was also reviewed.",
22240,Investigations showed that a majority of scholarship positions were not being used or that non-university members lived in the bursae.,
22241,The study progress and the discipline among the bursae and coderie residents were also unsatisfactory.,
22242,"Because of this, the university was to do regular checks (visitations) of the student accommodations and to pay attention to the correct allocation of places in the foundation bursae, since influential people often provided for clients in this way.",
22243,Despite these attempts at revitalizing the system a large number of the medieval bursae disappeared in the course of the 16th century.,
22244,"Among the reasons for this were changes in the university’s teaching ideals due to Renaissance humanism, competition by the Jesuits and also the changing catchment area of the University of Vienna, which focused more and more on Vienna and its surroundings.",
22245,"Students from the city usually did not need accommodations, since they still lived with their families.",
22246,"Especially the large bursae funded through endowments survived – for example the Rosenburse, the Lammburse or the Lilienburse.",
22247,"However, after numerous university buildings were given to the Jesuits in 1623, they were mostly transformed into financial scholarships, because the houses were demolished to make space for the building of the Jesuit church and the college building at today’s Dr. Ignaz Seipel-Platz.",
22248,The coderie Goldberg as the largest student alms house in Vienna also survived until the 20th century.,
22249,"After a few years without a residence when the coderie building was lost in 1623 it received a building in Johannesgasse, which was used until the 18th century.",
22250,"Only after this was it also transformed into a scholarship.
",
22251,"Despite massive destruction in the preceding years, the University of Vienna resumed operations immediately after the war.",
22252,Dealing with the university’s involvement in National Socialism and disciplining members who often were still advocates of Nazi ideology was overcast by the efforts of “reconstruction” and “new beginnings” after 1945.,
22253,National Socialism (and Austrofascism) had left deep marks that resonated at the university and outside it for years to come.,
22254,"On April 10, 1945, the first Soviet soldiers reached the Viennese university quarter and used the abandoned University Main Building as a dressing station and as stables.",
22255,"On April 25, Ludwig Adamovich sen. was elected as the first post-war rector and on May 29, 1945, lectures were resumed for the summer semester despite the ongoing reconstruction work at the university (the Main Building had been hit by 26 bombs).",
22256,"Students were used as workers for removing debris, for the transport of books and laboratory equipment that had been moved during the war as well as for the restoration of destroyed buildings.",
22257,After the end of the Second World War the institution’s involvement in National Socialism was essentially not accounted for.,
22258,“Denazification” of teachers and students dragged on until the late 1950s and about half of the “belastet” (incriminated),
22259,National Socialist professors were able to continue their academic careers after a few years.,
22260,"Only few of the academics expelled in 1938 returned to the university, however.",
22261,The ministry’s politics instead focused on appointing conservative Catholic teaching staff.,
22262,How much prominent National Socialist teachers shaped the political environment at the Viennese universities can be seen in the scandal surrounding openly anti-Semitic statements by professor of economic history Taras Borodajkewycz in 1965.,
22263,"However, the public attention it received and the outrage it sparked in the long term led to a first examination of the university’s history during National Socialism.",
22264,With Kurt Waldheim’s presidential candidacy in 1986 and the “Bedenkjahr” of 1988 (the 50th anniversary of the “Anschluss” to the German Reich) a discourse about the university’s role in National Socialism began within the institution.,
22265,"Important early initiatives in this context were started by dedicated historians and included the lecture series “Die Universität Wien 1938-1945” (1988) and the commemorative inscription for philosopher Moritz Schlick, who was murdered in the university in 1936 (1993).",
22266,"On the occasion of the university’s 625th anniversary in 1990, a first important paper on the expulsion of teachers in 1938 was published, namely the brochure “Vertriebene Intelligenz” (“Displaced Intelligence”).",
22267,"Around the turn of the millennium the University of Vienna increasingly examined its National Socialist past, for example in the senate project “Untersuchungen zur anatomischen Wissenschaft in Wien 1938-1945” (“Investigations on the anatomical science in Vienna”) and the commemorative plaque in the Arkadenhof (arcaded courtyard) dedicated to the expelled teachers and students of the Faculty of Medicine, which for the first time explicitly acknowledges the university’s co-responsibility.",
22268,"Other activities include several scientific symposiums, projects on the expulsion of students and teachers in 1938, provenance research, lectures and publications, as well as the establishment of the Forum “Zeitgeschichte der Universität Wien” (“Contemporary History of the University of Vienna”) as a coordination office for activities dealing with university history in the 20th and 21st century (2006–2015).",
22269,National Socialism also became the focus of a critical remembrance culture at the university and stepped into the foreground.,
22270,"In 1998, for example, all 24 passageways of the University of Vienna’s new Campus (the former General Hospital) were dedicated as “Tore der Erinnerung” (“Gates of Remembrance”).",
22271,Particularly names of women and teachers expelled during National Socialism – formerly underrepresented groups – were chosen for the gates.,
22272,The still existing Jewish prayer house at the new Campus was inaugurated in 2005 as a place of remembrance and encounter called DENK-MAL Marpe Lanefesch.,
22273,"The university’s new, reflected attitude towards its involvement in National Socialism could particularly be seen in regard to the historic and artistic contextualization of the German National monument “Siegfriedskopf” in 2006 and its relocation from the Main Building’s aula to the Arkadenhof.",
22274,"The spot vacated by the “Siegfriedskopf” was used for two commemorative alcoves with statements declaring what the university stands for today: remembrance of the victims of National Socialism, “for the freedom of sciences and respect of the human rights” and “against war and violence”.",
22275,"In the course of the rearrangement of the aula in 2006, the installation “Nobelpreis und Universität – ein Gruppenbild mit Fragezeichen” (“Nobel prize and university – a group picture with a question mark”) was also opened.",
22276,"Among other things, it details Julius Wagner-Jauregg’s and Konrad Lorenz’s involvement in National Socialism.",
22277,"Aside from these university-wide commemoration and remembrance activities, projects from various disciplines were also conducted in this time, such as the decentralized “Denkmal für Ausgegrenzte, Emigrierte und Ermordete des Kunsthistorischen Instituts der Universität Wien 1933/34 | 1938 | 1945” (“Monument for excluded, emigrated and murdered members of the Institute of Art History of the University of Vienna”) in 2008.",
22278,"Innovations in the context of remembrance also include virtual forms, such as the online “Gedenkbuch für die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus an der Universität Wien 1938” (“Memorial book for the victims of National Socialism at the University of Vienna in 1938”), which was presented in 2009 and is constantly being expanded as a work in progress.
",
22279,"On March 12, 1848, a student assembly passed a resolution to write a petition to the Emperor, in which, among other things, they demanded freedom of teaching and learning.",
22280,"This appeal, later joining the history of the revolutionary year of 1848 as the “student petition”, triggered a much-needed reform of Austria’s whole educational system.",
22281,"The principle of academic freedom – already established as “libertas philosophandi” at many German universities (Halle, Göttingen, Jena) – was, along with civil liberties (freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion etc.), one of the main catchphrases of the liberal demands for reform in Vienna of the revolutionary year 1848.",
22282,This principle was usually referred to as a unified whole – “freedom of teaching and learning” – but in fact referenced two separate areas: freedom of teaching (freedom of science and its teaching) and freedom of learning (freedom of study).,
22283,"Since Joseph II and Maria Theresia’s reforms, teaching at the university was strictly bound by state rules (appointment of professors, text books, curricula, supervision of lectures, etc.).",
22284,The introduction of freedom of teaching meant that those who had received their teaching license (venia docendi) as professors or private lecturers in a main scientific subject were allowed to freely present their own topics and schools of thought in their subjects.,
22285,The academic teacher had to “only answer to his own conscience”.,
22286,"He was, however, obligated to review and justify his views in light of new findings or questions that might arise.",
22287,The demand for freedom of study concerned several aspects.,
22288,"An important topic in 1848 was the suspension of semestral and annual exams which were obligatory for advancing to the next year and for receiving certain benefits (accommodations, scholarships, exemptions from tuition fees) and were hated by the students.",
22289,Another demand was the right to complete courses in any desired order and time and to be able to freely choose one’s teachers.,
22290,"With the general study regulations from October 1, 1850, the annual and semestral exams were dropped.",
22291,Attending foreign universities that also followed the principle of freedom of teaching and learning was now also allowed.,
22292,"The student petition from March 12, 1848, initiated a long overdue reform of the whole Austrian educational system and the transformation of the “Alma Mater Rudolphina” to a modern university for teaching and research.",
22293,"Franz von Sommaruga, the first Austrian Minister of Education, announced the widely demanded academic freedoms, as well as a restructuring of the educational system on March 30, 1848 in the aula of the university.",
22294,"To achieve this, he reassigned Franz Seraphin Exner, a philosophy professor from Prague, to the new ministry in Vienna.",
22295,Exner soon became the driving force of the reform.,
22296,"As early as summer 1848 he presented the “draft of the outline of the public educational system in Austria”, which became the basis of the educational and university reform implemented by the later minister of education Thun-Hohenstein (1849-1860).",
22297,"Exner’s ideas were guided by the successful Prussian educational model, which had been practiced for decades on the basis of freedom of teaching and learning and the combination of research and teaching.",
22298,"At the same time, he recognized that the Habsburg monarchy did not have enough qualified personnel for a “new university” that was supposed to conduct scientific research and teaching, while also guaranteeing freedom of teaching and freedom of study.",
22299,"This was attempted to be amended by appointing new foreign professors, especially from Germany.",
22300,"On the other hand, the Austrian young talent was to be supported by introducing the habilitation of private lecturers.",
22301,"A great help in this endeavor was the appointment of the Protestant high school teacher Hermann Bonitz as professor of classical philology, who developed the concepts of the reform together with Exner.",
22302,"Newly founded seminaries, institutes, laboratories and clinics were meant to acquaint the students with scientific research.",
22303,The student demands for freedom of teaching and learning from 1848 were already mostly met in the provisional reform laws under minister Thun-Hohenstein.,
22304,"What is more, freedom of teaching reached a constitutional level with the Staatsgrundgesetz of December 21, 1867: “Science and its teaching are free” (art. 17).",
22305,"The university reforms started in the revolutionary year of 1848 found their preliminary conclusion and a forward-looking codification with the law on the organisation of the academic authorities from April 27, 1873.",
22306,The remnants of the medieval corporative constitution were eradicated with the elimination of the doctoral councils.,
22307,"The universities were seen as public institutions with the purpose of scientific research and teaching, without their position as legal entities explicitly being rescinded.",
22308,Clerical influence was pushed back; the position of chancellor was restricted to the Faculty of Catholic Theology.,
22309,"Apart from an interruption during National Socialism, the law remained in effect until the Law on University Organisation was passed in 1955.
",
22310,The era of “Renaissance humanism” is marked by a spiritual orientation towards antiquity and its achievements.,
22311,"Starting in the cities, churches and courts of 14th century Italy, this educational movement spread to the territories of the Holy Roman Empire during the 15th and 16th centuries.",
22312,"Science and academic teachings, as well as cultural life in general experienced a radical reorientation.",
22313,"The spread of humanism in Europe Due to the invention of the printing press, humanistic literature was able to spread quickly at the beginning of the Modern Age.",
22314,Authors from the antiquity and the early Middle Ages were rediscovered and their works were republished in print in revised “cleaned” versions.,
22315,"Classic languages, the urban lifestyle and the life-affirming principles of the humanists were valued highly.",
22316,This stood in contrast with the scholastic educational tradition and the intellectuals’ monkish way of life and to their work which was oriented towards the afterlife.,
22317,Humanists scorned the “Gothic” Middle Ages and their “barbaric mock Latin”.,
22318,They opposed the stagnant scholastic teaching system with its outdated text books at the late medieval universities.,
22319,The humanistic intellectual movement initiated by Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374) put language at the center of human education.,
22320,Humanism flourished in the sovereigns’ courts and in private intellectual circles.,
22321,"Gradually, the studia humanitatis also entered the curricula of central European schools and universities at the turn of the 15th to the 16th century.",
22322,"Central humanistic disciplines were considered to be poetics, rhetoric, classical languages (Latin, Greek, Hebrew), as well as the “humanistic natural sciences” (scientiae mathematicae), in particular mathematics, astronomy and astrology, and soon also history and moral philosophy.",
22323,Educational travels by many intellectuals and students were responsible for the humanistic transfer of knowledge to the north.,
22324,Support of the movement by open-minded sovereigns also helped this cause.,
22325,"Noteworthy in this respect are for example the Luxembourger Emperor Charles IV (1316-1378) and his son, Emperor Sigismund (1368-1437), Louis the Great of Anjou (1326-1382), king of Hungary and Poland, and the Hungarian humanist king Matthias Corvinus (Hunyadi, 1443-1490).",
22326,"In Vienna, Enea Silvio Piccolomini (1405-1464) – the later Pope Pius II (1458) – introduced humanism to the court of Emperor Frederick III (1452-1493).",
22327,In 1442 he had already received the poet’s laurels.,
22328,He is considered the “pioneer of Renaissance humanism in Austria”.,
22329,"The first German-speaking intellectual to receive the coveted laurel crown (laurea) was the humanist Konrad Celtis (1459-1508) from Franconia, whose poet crowning was celebrated in Nuremberg in 1487.",
22330,The crown was considered to be the highest honor and visible symbol of a humanistic intellectual following the ancient example.,
22331,Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519) is regarded as a significant supporter of humanism.,
22332,"He employed famous intellectuals at his court that spread the ideology, such as Hieronymus Balbus, Johannes Cuspinianus, Johannes Stabius, Georg Tannstetter-Collimitius etc.",
22333,During his reign Maximilian crowned 29 candidates with the poet’s laurels.,
22334,As early as 1494 he had funded the first academic chair for Roman law at the Viennese Faculty of Law.,
22335,In 1497 he appointed the parade humanist Konrad Celtis to the University of Vienna.,
22336,He was to represent the leading humanistic disciplines of poetics and rhetoric.,
22337,"At first he did this outside of the Faculty of Arts, since they still were quite reserved towards the humanists.",
22338,"This was not necessarily due to the modern ideas, but to social tension between the open-minded, sometimes pretentious poets and the artist magisters who were used to a monasterial way of life and who feared for their privileges.",
22339,"Konrad Celtis, the “arch-humanist”, had been educated at the Italian centers of humanistic knowledge in Padua, Ferrara, Bologna, Florence, Venice and Rome.",
22340,"Then he had taught at prestigious universities such as Erfurt, Rostock, Leipzig, Cracow and Ingolstadt.",
22341,"He joined several humanist circles on his travels and participated in the foundation of humanistic intellectual societies in Heidelberg, Buda and Vienna (Sodalitas Danubiana Vondobonensis).",
22342,In 1501 Maximilian I founded the Collegium Poetarum et Mathematicorum at the University of Vienna and appointed Konrad Celtis as its head.,
22343,"It encompassed four humanistic academic chairs outside of the Faculty of Arts, paid for by the Landesfürst (prince).",
22344,The humanistic subjects only became a part of the Faculty of Arts in the course of the university reforms implemented by Ferdinand I in 1537.,
22345,"The Faculty of Arts subsequently adopted the name “Philosophical Faculty”.
",
22346,The reforms of the 18th century brought about an orientation of academic studies towards their usefulness and practicality for the functions of the state.,
22347,The expansion of the absolutist state with its bureaucratic institutions and central authorities required officials that were professionally qualified and loyal to the ruler.,
22348,"Medical training was also focused on, so as to improve the public’s access to good healthcare.",
22349,Rigid state control of the universities in the period of Restauration after the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars led to the danger of disconnecting university teaching from international scientific development.,
22350,"Only with the proclamation of freedom of teaching and study and the Thun-Hohenstein educational reforms in 1849/50, science and research became the university’s central tasks next to teaching.",
22351,These new conditions led to an unexpected development of intellectual resources which in turn helped the University of Vienna gain international renown in various scientific disciplines.,
22352,"Representative for this is the development of Viennese scientific “schools”, for example in medicine, national economy or art history.
",
22353,"Teachers and students of the University of Vienna acted as political actors in manifold ways during the 19th and 20th centuries.
",
22354,"“Male, honest, Christian” – this could be a short characterization of students at the medieval and early modern universities.",
22355,What requirements did the universities’ statutes ask from new admissions and how were these norms handled in practice?,
22356,The admission to the university took place through matriculation.,
22357,"This was not a purely administrative act for the statistical recording of students, but was the foundation of a person’s membership in the university and the subjection to its jurisdiction.",
22358,"This is why the registers (Matrikel) included the names of the students, but also those of the teachers, other employees as well as of artisans who worked for the university outside of the regular guild laws.",
22359,The registers also became continuously more sophisticated and representative.,
22360,"In contrast to today’s education system, which demands the graduation from a secondary school or a university entrance exam for admission to a university, there were no such regulations in the medieval school system.",
22361,"There was no system of successive schools that built on one another, but a variety of monastery, parish or city schools coexisting with each other.",
22362,"The subjects taught in these schools ranged from elementary skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic, to disciplines also taught at universities.",
22363,The standards mostly depended on the teacher’s knowledge and skills.,
22364,"Accordingly, there were almost no formal restrictions on admission of students to medieval universities.",
22365,"Most university statutes only demanded their candidates to be baptized, born in wedlock and having “moral conduct”.",
22366,Proof for the first two points often only had to be presented at graduation.,
22367,At some universities it was sufficient for the student to assert that he believed to have been born in wedlock.,
22368,"These regulations meant that mainly non-Christians – Jews, and Muslims on the Iberian Peninsula – were excluded from studying.",
22369,The de facto exclusion of women from universities actually had no judicial basis in the university statutes.,
22370,Higher education of women was perhaps so inconceivable for the administration that they did not think to add clauses to this effect to the statutes.,
22371,Since the beginning of the Reformation the universities also demanded students to declare their affiliation to either the Catholic or Protestant denomination.,
22372,"At some universities, however, there were loopholes to avoid these restrictions: The Venetian government, for example, established special medical and law schools in the early 17th century, which also awarded academic titles to non-Catholics.",
22373,The University of Padua protected its Protestant students from persecution by the Inquisition with an immunity privilege.,
22374,"Other regulations, such as regional or social origin, or intellectual, linguistic or financial prerequisites were not addressed at admission.",
22375,"Since even the largest universities were still a long way from the mass universities of the 20th and 21st century, the contact between teachers and students was far more intimate.",
22376,"The teachers picked their students personally, taking their level of education into account, thus implementing a certain minimum standard.",
22377,"Nevertheless, there is evidence that students occasionally learnt the scientific language of Latin or even reading and writing at the university.",
22378,"Admission into the “community of teachers and students” – the matriculation When a student had been accepted by a teacher, he was entered into the register.",
22379,"With the development of university structures, these student lists evolved from records kept privately by each teacher to member registries of the faculties, academic nations and the whole university, usually called “Matrikel” (the terms album, rotulus or cedula were also sometimes used).",
22380,"The entry in the registries (most often kept by the rectorate) was the foundation of a person’s membership in the university and held high importance, since the universities possessed their own judicial system.",
22381,"The legal act was usually divided into three parts: After the new arrival had petitioned the rector for matriculation, he paid a fee which depended on social status and financial possibilities.",
22382,"He then swore to uphold the university statutes, to obey the rector as the head of the university, to support the community to the best of his abilities and to not take revenge for injustices he might suffer.",
22383,At the conclusion of this ceremony his name was entered into the register.,
22384,This was usually done by the rector himself or – from the 16th century onward – by clerks.,
22385,At some universities the students entered their names into the register themselves.,
22386,"Because the matriculation was evidence of a person’s subjection to the university’s legal system, not only students were entered into the register, but also teachers, other university employees, such as professors’ servants or artisans working for the university, were recorded as well.",
22387,The latter were also called “academic citizens”.,
22388,Design of the register – from functional manuscript to representational object The registers are structured by rectors’ (or deans’ or bursars’),
22389,terms of office.,
22390,In the rector’s register the entries after 1385 are sorted by membership in the four academic nations.,
22391,"A single matriculation ideally includes the date of enrollment (usually the semester, sometimes even the exact date), name and origin, as well as information on payment and amount of register fees or on the exemption from them.",
22392,"In some cases, details on the studied discipline and later course of life can also be found.",
22393,This form of matriculation was maintained until the obligatory matriculation was abolished in 1784.,
22394,"When the matriculation was reintroduced in the early 19th century, the name and profession of the father or legal guardian was added as well.",
22395,"This ideal was not always adhered to, however.",
22396,"Only since the middle of the 17th century consistent information on the studied discipline was recorded, while the data on paid register fees became increasingly sporadic from this time onwards.",
22397,"In the worst cases, the entry only included the name.",
22398,"If this concerned a person, who – as was not unusual in the Middle Ages – did not use a surname, it is almost impossible to find further biographical data.",
22399,"The registers, at first unornamented functional manuscripts, became increasingly more elaborately designed from the end of the 17th century.",
22400,"The – often aristocratic – rectors had registers adorned with lavish, sometimes colored, decorative sheets with their crests or with allegoric illustrations.",
22401,"Reports on events or laws concerning the university as well as other notes on things such as marriages or deaths in the royal family, wars, plagues or the like, were entered into the register.",
22402,"Exmatriculation as a disciplinary measure Ideally, the membership in the academic community which had begun at the matriculation held a lifetime.",
22403,"University members could, however, be expelled from this community as well.",
22404,"Since the university membership was bound to privileges, temporary or permanent exmatriculations were used as disciplinary measures: The offender’s name was struck from the register.",
22405,"In some cases, the reasons for the expulsion were named.",
22406,"These ranged from offences against the university’s disciplinary regulations to criminal charges such as theft, forgery of documents, heresy, adultery or murder..
",
22407,"“Free education”, “against tuition fees”, “no social selection” and similar demands are often put forward in the – sometimes fiercely, sometimes not so vigorously fought – debate about universities and in particular their financing.",
22408,"In this context, it is often also argued that there had supposedly been no admission restrictions in the past and that it had therefore been possible for “the poor” to study.",
22409,How was the situation at the University of Vienna in actual fact?,
22410,The medieval university statutes did indeed not include any limitations in regard to the students’ financial situation and even offered partial exemptions from fees for poor people.,
22411,"An overview of the costs that accrued during the studies, however, shows that while these exemptions somewhat mitigated the financial burden, studying at the university still put an enormous strain on the students’ wallets.",
22412,"When compared to contemporary wages, a university education was hardly affordable for people with a low income.",
22413,The University of Vienna – like other medieval universities – was open to students regardless of their financial background.,
22414,This general openness should however not be confused with the now often discussed expression of “(cost-)free education”.,
22415,"Along the way into and through the university, fees became due regularly.",
22416,"Poor students (also called pauperes) could be exempted from some of these fees, but a complete course of studies at the university still meant a large burden for the students’ and their families’ finances.",
22417,"Basically, study costs could be divided into two groups: On the one hand there were direct study costs, payable to the university.",
22418,"On the other hand, the living expenses had to be covered.",
22419,Students already had to pay their first fee when joining the university.,
22420,"The matriculation consisted of the entry into the register, an oath to uphold the university statutes and certainly not least of the payment of the matriculation fee.",
22421,This payment was also recorded in the register.,
22422,"The fee was not the same for all students, but changed with regard to the faculty chosen and the students’ social status.",
22423,"From 1413 onwards students at the Faculty of Arts paid twelve Kreuzer for the entry into the register, while those at the Faculties of Theology, Law or Medicine had to pay 24 Kreuzer.",
22424,"The fee for magisters or doctors from other universities was higher than that for normal students, with matriculation fees of 15 and 30 Kreuzer.",
22425,Clergy and nobility also had to pay higher fees: They ranged from 30 Kreuzer for members of the lower nobility and cathedral canons up to three guilders (180 Kreuzer) for dukes and bishops.,
22426,"Poor students, in contrast, did not have to pay matriculation fees.",
22427,"Just as the matriculation marked a student’s entry into the university, the Deposition made the new student (“Grünschnabel” – “greenhorn”) part of the student body.",
22428,The fee for this ceremony was six Kreuzer.,
22429,"After overcoming these first financial obstacles, fees for lectures and disputations became due.",
22430,These varied according to the read book.,
22431,"At the faculty of arts, lecture fees ranged from six to 36 Kreuzer, while teachers at the faculty of law received one guilder per study year for their held lectures.",
22432,Disputation fees were twelve to 72 Kreuzer.,
22433,"In the course of the 15th century, these fees were raised several times.",
22434,"With the 1554 Reformatio Nova the costs for obligatory lectures at the faculty of arts were abolished, since the professors were now paid by the Landesfürst (local sovereign).",
22435,There is almost no information on the costs of books and writing materials.,
22436,"Hand-written books were unaffordable for most students, but also printed books – usually cheaper than hand-written ones – had prices starting at about one guilder, equivalent to the yearly fee for professors at the Faculty of Law or the matriculation fee for abbots or barons.",
22437,"Because of this, the Faculty of Arts held dictation hours (pronunciationes), at which students could write their own copies.",
22438,"If you wanted to graduate, this also came with its own costs.",
22439,"Once a student had finished his doctorate, he had to pay fees to the faculty, the examiners, the participating magisters and doctors as well as to the caretaker.",
22440,These fees ranged from eight Kreuzer for the caretaker to two guilders for the faculty and the doctors.,
22441,The usually much higher costs for the following celebration can only be estimated with difficulty.,
22442,"They included the graduate’s ceremonial clothing, music, presents for the attendees and the traditional doctor’s feast.",
22443,"Some reports about doctorates name costs up to 200 guilders, which explains why only few students aspired to graduate.",
22444,Apart from these study costs the students also had to cover the daily costs of living.,
22445,"Mainly, this meant costs for housing and food, as well as clothing, leisure activities and possibly medical care.",
22446,"Since a large part of Viennese students came from outside of Vienna, they had to look for accommodations in the city.",
22447,Those students that did not find places in bursae and coderies controlled by the university took lodgings with citizens.,
22448,"Yearly rent in a bursa amounted to between five and seven guilders, which probably included additional costs such as heating and tuition.",
22449,Expenses for the bed or other furniture were usually not included.,
22450,"Rent in a coderie, a student alms house was about three to four guilders.",
22451,There are varying reports on whether these prices also included meals.,
22452,This presumably differed from bursa to bursa.,
22453,Other expenses such as clothing depended strongly on the students’ financial background.,
22454,"Thus, no general statements can be made about them.",
22455,"Assertions about the total costs of studying at the University of Vienna can only be seen as approximations, since the accruing costs are only partially known.",
22456,"Most reports are in regard to the Faculty of Arts, and since also the majority of students studied here, the statements will be restricted to this faculty.",
22457,"Yearly study costs, including possible graduations, ranged from 14 to 21 guilders.",
22458,Poor students were able to reduce these costs to between four and six guilders due to exemptions from fees.,
22459,"Comparing these numbers to contemporary wages shows that even if a student was classified as a pauper, studying was not affordable – or only with great difficulty – for large parts of the population: A servant at the Viennese Bürgerspital (citizens’ hospital) received a yearly wage of just under one guilder.",
22460,A cook was paid three and a half guilders and the hospital director received 15 guilders.,
22461,This comparison makes it clear why the phenomenon of the “working student” was already prevalent in the Middle Ages and why there was a large number of mainly private scholarship foundations.,
22462,"Even with various exemptions from fees for so-called “poor” students, attending a university was only really possible for people from a good financial background.
",
22463,"Vienna’s development to a political, religious, cultural and economic center, as the capital city of a future Austrian kingdom were the backdrop to the lofty plans of a young Habsburg prince, Duke Rudolf IV.",
22464,In view of his generous expansion of St. Stephen’s cathedral and the foundation of the University of Vienna he received the epithet “the Founder”.,
22465,"On March 12, 1365, becoming the first university founder without a king’s crown, Duke Rudolf IV sealed the founding document for the Viennese House of Studies with the right to award doctorates in all “permitted” sciences following the example of the University of Paris.",
22466,"This foundation’s confirmation followed on June 18, 1365, by",
22467,"Pope Urban V. He however withheld his approval to a theological faculty, leaving the Viennese studium generale without the status of a full university.",
22468,"A reason for this restraint may have been an intervention by Emperor Charles IV, who feared competition for the University of Prague that he had founded in 1348.",
22469,The economic and spatial requirements were also not met in 1365.,
22470,Duke Rudolf should not learn of these problems.,
22471,"He died on July 27, 1365, at age 25, on a trip to Milan.",
22472,"We know today that his institution still came into being, even if not all the provisions from the founding document were implemented.",
22473,"Apart from the theological studies, the university quarter which was planned to be built between the Hofburg and the Schottentor in the Herrengasse – called “Pfaffenstadt” (“priest city”) in the founding document – was not realized.",
22474,Albert of Rickensdorf (†1390) became the first rector of the university.,
22475,"He was a theologian and natural scientist originally from Saxony, who had worked in Paris and later became bishop of Halberstadt.",
22476,"At first, the lectures were held in St. Stephen’s secondary school which was associated with the university.  ",
22477,"The founder’s brother, Duke Albert III, expanded the university in 1384:",
22478,"He added the Faculty of Theology and had it approved by Pope Urban VI, as well as inaugurated the first actual university building, the Duke’s College (collegium ducale), opposite the Dominican monastery in what is today the Postgasse.",
22479,"The free community of teachers and students, the universitas magistrorum et scholarium, formed the organizational superstructure of the general studies, which consisted of several academic bodies.",
22480,"These corporationsformed the four faculties (theology, law, medicine, artists) as teachers’ organizations, led by Deans, the four academic nations (Natio Australium, Rhenensium, Ungarorum, Saxonum) as territorial organizations of the students, led by procurators, and the Duke’s College as an independent community with an elected prior at its head.",
22481,"The university’s collective head was the Rector Magnificus, who, until 1848, was elected by the four procurators.",
22482,"He presided over the university’s Consistory, which exercised the university’s special jurisdiction and became the university’s highest administrational board.",
22483,"Other members of the Consistory were the dean of St. Stephen’s cathedral as the university chancellor, and the Landesfürst’s (prince’s) superintendent, who was responsible for the endowments, as well as the prior of the Duke’s College.",
22484,The Great Western Schism (1378-1417) facilitated the influx of distinguished scientists who left the Parisian university.,
22485,"For example, Heinrich Heimbuche of Langenstein, a famous theologian and natural scientist (†1397) joined the university.",
22486,"He supported the university’s expansion and, together with other well-known teachers, motivated many students to come to Vienna.  ",
22487,"On October 5, 1384, in an important step, Duke Albert III gave the university the right to give itself statutes.",
22488,"This right was regarded as the cornerstone of university autonomy, as was often mentioned in later discussions.",
22489,As early as 1385 the university passed statutes for the university as a whole and in 1389 for the four faculties.,
22490,"These statutes included regulations for discipline, elections, academic officials’ duties, and rules for the study, exam and doctorate systems.",
22491,"Apart from the small income the university had been receiving from the Laa an der Thaya parish since 1366, the Duke mandated that the university would receive an additional yearly 680 pounds of Pfennige from the tolls at Emmersdorf an der Donau.",
22492,"In his testament, he decreed that the university should receive an “eternal pledge” of 800 pounds yearly from the toll at Ybbs, which his nephew, Duke William, confirmed by document in 1405.",
22493,"With this, the University of Vienna’s founding phase was completed.",
22494,"The oldest continually existing university in the German-speaking world owes its establishment and its legal and economic security to this founding and constitutional phase.
",
22495,A university’s “house” is always much more than just a building.,
22496,Of course it offers the roof under which research is done and students are taught.,
22497,"But most of all, it is the location of the encounter between teachers and students, the space in which the community, the universitas, comes into existence.",
22498,"Thus, the architecture itself becomes a place of identification with the institution.",
22499,"At the same time, the demands placed on the possible architects by different members of the contracting commission are far from uniform or constant.",
22500,An analytical look at the Main Building on the Ring opened in 1884 shows which (self-)conception is reflected here and with which ideals the community should identify.,
22501,"A return of the potentially insurgent students after the revolution of 1848 to the historically loaded New Aula,  site of the conspiracy to murder war minister Latour, was out of the question.",
22502,Emperor Franz Josef thus decided in May of 1854 to build a new university building.,
22503,"Until the opening in October 1884, 30 years later, however, the Alma Mater Rudolphina remained without a center.",
22504,"Since especially the Faculty of Medicine profited from its proximity to the General Hospital General Hospital in its temporary accommodations, the Minister of Education instructed the two academy professors Eduard van der Nüll and August von Sicardsburg in 1854 to draw up plans for a university at an empty site near the Schwarzspanier church.",
22505,At this representative building site the main façade of the new university would have directly overlooked the glacis to the Schotten-gate.,
22506,"At this point, nobody thought about giving up the fortifications and the unobstructable glacis.",
22507,"The next year, another architect wanted to take advantage of the sloping terrain of the glacis for his monumental building, Heinrich von Ferstel, only 26 years old and a student of Sicardsburg and Van der Nüll, had won the contest for the Votiv church and wanted to construct the important building directly on this terrain for best visibility.",
22508,"In accordance with the university’s “Catholic character” aimed for by Thun-Hohenstein, the three architects agreed on an architectural combination of university and church, in which the main building would have encompassed the sacral building’s chancel.",
22509,"But this civitas universitatis also was not realized and the whole construction project stagnated until 1868, when finally Heinrich von Ferstel himself was commissioned to do preliminary work for the new building.",
22510,Ferstel however also at first failed to accomplish an aesthetically successful combination of the two institutions on the irregular building site.,
22511,"Only when faced with the prospect of the representative spot directly on the Ringstraße in 1869, Ferstel enthusiastically threw himself into the plans and tried to give the university an appropriate building in the context of that grand avenue.",
22512,"While the style of the first sketches was oriented towards the neighboring parliament and city hall, the second draft was geared towards a massive monumental building, referencing paragons from the Renaissance.",
22513,"The few preserved documents regarding the style debate show that from the blueprints to the style and the décor the building represents the self-conception of a deterministic view of science, promising a “victory of light against darkness”.",
22514,Ferstel attempted to express this idea of light in the architecture as well as the decorations and also set this theme for the ceremonial hall.,
22515,"When the artists Franz Matsch and Gustav Klimt were entrusted with this task in 1894, however, it resulted in one of the greatest art scandals of the 20th century, since at least Klimt had already moved away from the 19th century notion of science.",
22516,"Looking at the long history of the main building, from the planning stage to the construction, one can see how the functional and representative demands on the “house” of the Alma Mater Rudolphina were in constant flux and how Ferstel tried to meet them.",

",
22519,Three years mark the history of the Jesuits at the University of Vienna:,
22520,"In 1550 the order was called to Vienna by the sovereign King Ferdinand I, in 1623 the Jesuit College was incorporated into the university and finally in 1773 the order was suppressed by decree of Pope Clement XIV, which ended the Viennese Jesuit College.",
22521,"After Martin Luther’s reformation had arrived in the Habsburg territory and especially in the city of Vienna, Ferdinand I took measures to stabilize his reign and to reform Christian life in his lands.",
22522,"In this, the University of Vienna had a central role: As cradle of the Catholic clergy and training center for future state officials.",
22523,"In 1533 and 1537 reform laws were implemented, which aimed to transform the medieval university corporation into a Catholic state university.",
22524,"The young Society of Jesus, which had devoted itself to the “salvation of souls”, caught the eye of King Ferdinand I. One of the closest companions of the order’s founder Ignatius of Loyola, Claudius Jajus (Claude Jay), won the sovereign’s trust and founded an interest group at the 1550 Diet of Augsburg.",
22525,This group would shape the future Austrian educational system.,
22526,The sovereign was in the process of consolidating his reign based on Catholicism.,
22527,"In this, he had found a potential partner in the Society of Jesus, which could be presented as the “savior” of the decaying Catholic educational system.",
22528,"Although the Society of Jesus did not see itself as a teaching order, youth work soon became one of its main tasks.",
22529,An “inner mission” was supposed to answer the muddled denominational situation in the Catholic areas.,
22530,To achieve this they wanted to approach the malleable youth.,
22531,The order’s founder Ignatius of Loyola “knew of no better device against the universal German sickness than using impeccable and religious men at the universities”.,
22532,King Ferdinand’s initiative to found a Jesuit College in Vienna was welcomed by Ignatius as a divine inspiration.,
22533,For the college’s establishment Ferdinand asked for a delegation of two order members who also were to lecture at the Faculty of Theology.,
22534,"Claudius Jajus was the first to arrive in Vienna from Ingolstadt on April 25, 1551.",
22535,"Soon after, a second group of eleven Jesuits arrived from Rome.",
22536,They received accommodations in a desolate side wing of the Dominican monastery.,
22537,The priests immediately began lecturing at the Faculty of Theology.,
22538,"Claudius Jajus reported to Rome that there were “good professors of the humanities, Greek, Hebrew, philosophy, medicine and law at the university”, but that he suspected some of them of “heresy”.",
22539,"Competent professors were scarce, but those who were not “loyal Catholics” should still be dismissed in his opinion.",
22540,At first the idea to base all subjects apart from law and medicine at the Jesuit College and to establish publically accessible studies there could not be put into practice.,
22541,This idea became the starting point of altercations between the university and Jesuits.,
22542,"At the same time Ferdinand achieved the sending of Petrus Canisius to Vienna, who was supposed to continue the university reform.",
22543,He wanted to invigorate the university and make it attractive by appointing studied professors with Jesuit teaching methods to teaching positions and through the good example of successful Jesuit scholars.,
22544,In 1553 Canisius joined the reform commission and spoke out for the dismissal of “heretic” professors.,
22545,Replacing all non-Catholics at the university with Jesuits would have failed due to the lack of personnel.,
22546,"Canisius took a hard line and succeeded in getting the head of the school of the Protestant estates and professor at the Faculty of Arts, Nikolaus Polites from Brussels, incarcerated and banished from the country.",
22547,Canisius regretted the punishment’s “leniency” in a letter to the Jesuit Superior General.,
22548,"He was of the opinion it would encourage the “damned plague among professors and students”, while the university was feeding “monsters and heretics”.",
22549,"On January 1, 1554, the university obtained a new constitutional charter, known as the “Reformatio Nova”.",
22550,It drove back the medieval corporative character and expanded the sovereign’s influence in the university.,
22551,Certain authors and books were prescribed for the compulsory lectures and the chairs were given to state-funded professors.,
22552,"The collegiate funds, which had been the financial basis for independently lecturing doctors, were abolished and the right of co-optation was reduced to a vague nominating power for appointments.",
22553,At the same time the sovereign improved the university’s economic basis.,
22554,The verification of newly appointed professors’ religious confession was made less strict in a response to the available supply of personnel.,
22555,It is not known how much Canisius himself or other Jesuits directly worked on the reform law.,
22556,"In any case, it remained the University of Vienna’s basic constitution until the Theresian-Josephinist reforms of the 18th century.",
22557,Since the beginnings of the Catholic reform in Austria it was clear that the renewal of the parish and pastoral clergy could not exclusively come from the reservoir of students of the Society of Jesus.,
22558,"The flourishing Trivial school in the Jesuit College, in which grammar and humanities were taught, also began educating external students.",
22559,In 1553 the university had hesitantly given its approval to the establishment of a public school.,
22560,"When the priests added a philosophical course of studies, also accepted students from outside of the order and even gave master’s degrees to non-Jesuits, the “casus belli” was given.",
22561,Not even Pope Pius IV could change this when he gave the order the right to establish Jesuit Colleges with the right to award doctorates in artistic and theological subjects in 1561.,
22562,For more than 50 years the fight over the allocation of responsibilities continued.,
22563,"The university repeatedly demanded the suspension of public lessons in the College and the complete “abolishment of Jesuits” in Vienna, since they drew students to their College in “dishonest competition”.",
22564,"Not least because of their tuition-free education, the Jesuits had up to 1000 students.",
22565,"Tenaciously, the university defended its old monopoly on education and its old privileges.",
22566,It was threatened with the consolidation of the university and college and with it the end of the university corporation.,
22567,"While access to the university for non-Catholics had been facilitated under Emperor Maximilian II (1564-1576) and even Protestant rectors and professors had been tolerated, under Emperor Rudolf II (1576-1612) the turbulent “Khlesl era” followed, which was marked by counter-reformational measures.",
22568,In 1578 the rightfully elected rector was deposed because he refused to participate in the Corpus Christi procession.,
22569,"Melchior Khlesl, from a Protestant Viennese family, Jesuit student and later archbishop of Vienna, became dean of St. Stephen’s cathedral and university chancellor in 1579.",
22570,He enacted an obligatory Roman-Catholic profession of faith for all graduates.,
22571,"Although Khlesl had vehemently opposed the Jesuits’ interests as university rector and had wanted to withdraw both of their chairs of theology, a reform commission was established under his rule, which for the first time discussed handing over all philosophical studies to the Jesuits in 1609.",
22572,"The four faculties wrote lengthy assessments of this idea, prophesying the “ruin of the whole university”.",
22573,"Even the theologians, who highly praised the Jesuits, stressed the “impossibility” of this plan – an “impossible” plan which finally became a reality after turbulent disputes.",
22574,In 1623 the Viennese Jesuit College was incorporated into the university by decree of Emperor Ferdinand II.,
22575,The order received most of the professorships at the Faculty of Theology and all at the Faculty of Philosophy.,
22576,"At the same time the university’s buildings and several bursae – except for the jurists’ and physicians’ buildings – were given to the Society of Jesus with the mandate to construct the Academic College (“Collegium Academicum Viennense Societatis Jesu”) complete with a church, theater, library and observatory in their place.",
22577,The classes of the Faculties of Theology and Philosophy were to be held in this new college.,
22578,"As a consequence of the Jesuit College’s incorporation, a “double-tracked” administration was developed.",
22579,"The Jesuit College’s “Father rector” was responsible for his order’s brothers and students, but could not be elected university rector, while the rector conversely could not be a member of the Society of Jesus.",
22580,In 1628 the rectorate moved into a house at Sonnenfelsgasse 19 – today called “domus antiqua” – which was provided by the Jesuits.,
22581,Until the relocation into the Ring palace in 1884 this remained the headquarters of the university administration.,
22582,More than 2000 high school pupils and students were educated by 17-20 priests at the Academic College.,
22583,"Apart from the Faculty of Theology, the priests supervised six high school classes (parvists, principists, grammatists, syntaxists, poets, rhetors) and the subjects of the Faculty of Philosophy (logic, physics, metaphysics).",
22584,Besides their teaching work the Jesuits from the Viennese college often also stood out through research.,
22585,People who should be highlighted include Fr.,
22586,"Paul Guldin (1577-1643), who wrote mathematical-astronomical works (“Guldinus theorem”) and who was in contact with Johannes Kepler.",
22587,Other famous Jesuits working in mathematics were Fr.,
22588,Gabriel Frölich (1657-1725) and Fr.,
22589,Franz Rescalli (1651-1713).,
22590,"In the historical sciences productive order members included the author of the “Annales Austriae” and the “Annales ecclesiastici Germaniae”, Fr.",
22591,Sigismund Calles (1695-1761) or Fr.,
22592,Franz Molindes (1678-1768) who wrote a “Synopsis historiae universalis” until Emperor Charles VI.,
22593,In the natural sciences particularly the all-round talented Fr.,
22594,"Joseph Franz (1704-1776) should be mentioned, who founded a widely recognized “Museum mathematicum” with equipment for optics, astronomy, geography, geometry etc. and later was head of the observatory built in 1733.",
22595,Fr.,
22596,"Maximilian Hell (1720-1792) acquired a good reputation in the field of astronomy as director of the observatory and through his calculation of the ephemerides (tables of the daily positions of celestial bodies), which were publicized in 37 volumes.",
22597,"When Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Society of Jesus in 1773, the order’s possessions were integrated into the study fund and the Academic College and the Jesuit church were gifted to the university.",
22598,"Some of the “ex-Jesuits” continued teaching and doing research at the University of Vienna.
",
22599,"The police state under Metternich, characterized by the persecution of liberals, censorship and repression of freedom of press, speech and assembly, did not allow academic freedoms to develop.",
22600,The Austrian university system of the Vormärz (pre-March era) was based on the educational reforms from the time of Maria Theresia and her son Joseph II.,
22601,Important innovations were the nationalization of the formerly independent universities as well as the orientation of academic studies towards being useful for and applicable to functions of the state.,
22602,State oversight under the banner of late Enlightenment and Josephinism took the place of clerical Jesuit dominance.,
22603,"The “hohe Schulen” (literally “high schools”; universities) were no longer treated as corporations, but as “organizations of the state”.",
22604,"They had the purpose of training officials, advocates, doctors and clerics etc.",
22605,Scientific research and innovation were not part of their responsibilities.,
22606,Added to this were strict supervision of the teaching by governmental study directors and the restriction of the curricula to approved textbooks and scripts.,
22607,"The students had to pass an obligatory two-year “Cursus philosophicus” at the Faculty of Philosophy as a remedial course in order to then study at one of the three “higher faculties”: theology (3 years), law (4 years) or medicine (5 years).",
22608,The tough exams (Rigorosen) were held under the supervision of state-appointed study directors.,
22609,Professors were excluded from academic functions and only had teaching duties.,
22610,"The great successes the German reform universities such as Halle, Göttingen, or Jena had achieved under the banner of freedom of teaching and learning, and through focusing on scientific qualifications of their teaching staff, were recognized in the Habsburg monarchy.",
22611,"However, similar liberal reforms were not carried out here.",
22612,"The foundation of an Academy of Sciences as a breeding ground for innovative research also only remained an often mentioned, but unrealized plan until 1847.",
22613,"Scientific research thus stayed restricted to the medical clinics (General Hospital) and the court institutes (collections, museums, libraries, archives).",
22614,"The police state under Metternich, characterized by the persecution of liberals, censorship and repression of freedom of press, speech and assembly, did not allow academic freedoms to develop.",
22615,"Austria’s educational system remained conservative, informed by Catholicism, and isolated from foreign contacts.",
22616,It was forbidden to study at foreign universities.,
22617,"Generations of professors were drafted from studied encyclopaedists, who had no knowledge of scientific research.",
22618,"Because of this development, the university’s teachings lost connection with intellectual Europe.",
22619,"Thun’s advisor Karl Ernst Jarcke said in this regard: “The spirit of science had taken leave from the country’s universities, and since time immemorial no Austrian professor had had a German, let alone a European name”.",
22620,Cautious attempts made after 1800 to modernize the outdated studies and to establish “free lectures” alongside the obligatory ones changed little about the universities’ backwardness.,
22621,"The school-like study system with roll calls, the hated collegial, semestral and annual exams and the obligatory participation in academic church services remained in effect.",
22622,"These restrictions would finally be lifted as a result of the revolutionary movement in 1848.
",
22623,"Magnifice Domine Rector et Venerabile Consistorium: This title, to be found on many documents from the early Modern Age, names the university’s highest authorities: the rector as elected head of the university, who oversaw the official duties together with the Consistory, which was formed by the heads of the individual corporations.",
22624,"In the Middle Ages and the early Modern Age, the university consisted of different sub-corporations like faculties and nations, which each represented separate legal bodies.",
22625,"These separate entities took care of their own official business, but were also integrated into the university’s general administration through deans and procurators.",
22626,"At the head of the overall corporation stood the head of the “community of teachers and students”, called the rector, who was elected for a certain period.",
22627,A new rector was elected every semester at the University of Vienna – on the day of the saints Tiburtius and Valerianus (April 14) for the summer semester and on St. Coloman’s Day (October 13) for the winter semester.,
22628,In 1629 his term of office was extended to a whole study year.,
22629,"The elections were held on St. Leopold’s Day (November 15), and from 1660 on St. Andrew’s Day (November 30).",
22630,The procurators of the four academic nations elected the rector.,
22631,"To ensure that the four faculties participated in the university leadership as evenly as possible, the rectorate changed hands at regular intervals.",
22632,Only members of religious orders were excluded from these duties.,
22633,"This arrangement was loosened in the 16th century, as was the restriction of the rector’s position to unmarried men.",
22634,In the summer semester of 1534 the first married man was elected rector.,
22635,The rector was the highest representative of the university.,
22636,"Internally, he governed the university assembly and the Consistory.",
22637,He also exercised the university’s jurisdiction over its members and led the university’s accounts.,
22638,"Since the end of the 15th century, the rector was addressed with the honorific “magnificus”, which has been preserved until today in the title of “Magnifizenz”.",
22639,"Despite this wealth of competences the rector was no absolute ruler in his academic realm, but primus inter pares, first among equals: Apart from the sub-corporations that took part in the university administration, the church as well as the local sovereign tried to exert influence on the university through their representatives.",
22640,"Medieval universities were clerical institutions, which is why the local bishop or a representative of his choosing had a right to supervision of the university.",
22641,"At most universities, this supervision was a purely formal matter or was subject to severe restrictions.",
22642,"In Vienna, the dean of St. Stephen’s cathedral held the office of university chancellor.",
22643,His main capacity was to oversee exams and to grant authorization to teach to the licentiate and doctorate candidates.,
22644,"Often the chancellor delegated this power to a deputy, which led to arguments with the university, since these deputies sometimes had not graduated themselves.",
22645,"A serious dispute between the chancellor and the university broke out at the beginning of the 16th century, when the cathedral’s dean Paul of Oberstein demanded primacy over the rector and the right to utilize it.",
22646,In the course of the fight against the reformatory ideology the chancellor took control of the university members: Since 1581 he accepted the graduates’ profession of faith to the Catholic Church and since 1649 he took their oath on the dogma of Mary’s Immaculate Conception.,
22647,In the 18th century the chancellor’s authorities were cut by abolishing the old doctorate oath and the Catholic confession of faith.,
22648,In 1873 his office was restricted to the Faculty of Catholic Theology.,
22649,The beginnings of this royal supervisory position are connected to the university’s first dotation by Duke Wilhelm:,
22650,"After he had allocated a yearly 800 guilders to the university from income from the toll at Ybbs in 1405, he decided that the administration and distribution of this money should be done by his representative.",
22651,"The university, however, received the right to choose a candidate itself.",
22652,"This official first was known as “conservator”, later as “superintendent”.",
22653,"Since the administrators of various individual foundations also were called superintendents, the Duke’s representative became known as “landesfürstlich” (the Landesfürst was the local sovereign), and later “imperial” superintendent.",
22654,"Through Ferdinand I’s reform laws his position was strengthened considerably: Since 1533 changes to the foundation’s finances were dependent on his approval, and in 1537 he obtained control over all of the university’s finances.",
22655,"Instructions for the superintendent, published in 1556, defined the financial administration as his main task.",
22656,"Because this included paying the professors’ wages, he also controlled the university teachers’ activities.",
22657,In 1754 the office was suspended after its duties were divided between the study directors of the faculties and the university treasurer.,
22658,In the university’s early years decisions were made by all doctors and licentiates.,
22659,Votes on business decisions were held separately by the faculties; a majority was necessary to reach a decision.,
22660,"Baccalarii, students and academic citizens were usually not eligible to vote and were excluded from the assemblies.",
22661,Only in matters of payments by the university all university members were allowed to vote.,
22662,"Besides the general university assembly there also was the Consistory, which at first mainly dealt with matters of jurisprudence.",
22663,"Apart from the rector, the deans and seniors of the four faculties, as well as the procurators of the academic nations were members.",
22664,"Over time the university assembly delegated more and more business decisions to the Consistory, which in turn gained importance.",
22665,In 1481 the university assembly decreed that Consistory decisions were equally ranked to decisions of the general assembly.,
22666,In the course of the university reforms under Ferdinand I in 1534 the Consistory was confirmed as the university’s central authority.,
22667,The university chancellor and the royal superintendent also received chairs in the Consistory.,
22668,Together with the rector they were designated “consistorial dignitaries” (proceres consistorii).,
22669,"Among other things, the consistory was the university contact for various royal and government offices and addressee for their decrees.",
22670,The matters these decrees concerned were either directly decided upon in the Consistory or were passed on for review by the faculties.,
22671,"After the arbitration, the Consistory returned the results to the appropriate office.",
22672,"With the incorporation of the Jesuit College into the university and the subsequent subordination of the Faculties of Philosophy and Theology under the order’s control, the rector of the Jesuit College also received a place in the Consistory.",
22673,"He was, however, excluded from the election of the rector actively and passively.",
22674,"The reforms suggested by Gerhard van Swieten not only led to massive changes in teaching, but also in the administration.",
22675,"Besides changes in the faculties’ leadership and the university’s financial administration, the university leadership was also affected by this.",
22676,"The Consistory, until that point responsible for the whole of the university administration was divided up into two institutions in 1752: The “Consistory for legal matters” consisted of the rector and the procurator from the Faculty of Law (either the incumbent or a former procurator), the dean, as well as six advocates appointed by the local sovereign, who served as assessors.",
22677,"Here, the university’s civil and criminal legal cases were adjudicated.",
22678,"The “regular Consistory”, whose members included the rector, the faculties’ study directors as well as – just like before – the deans, seniors and procurators, was responsible for all other matters.",
22679,This division became redundant with the abolition of the university jurisprudence in 1784.,
22680,"In the 19th century, the reforms initiated by Leo Graf Thun-Hohenstein again led to profound changes in the organization of the academic authorities, which also affected the university leadership.",
22681,"The most important changes concerned the rector’s election and the Consistory’s composition, which was more often being called the “academic senate”.",
22682,With the abolition of the academic nations in 1849 the rector could no longer be elected by the procurators.,
22683,The consistory stepped in as the voting authority.,
22684,"It consisted of the rector and the prorector (the current rector’s predecessor), the deans and vice deans as well as of representatives from the professors’ collegiate and until 1873 the doctors’ collegiate.",
22685,"While the rector (just like the deans) was elected every year, the term of the professors in the senate lasted three years.",
22686,"The academic senate was still responsible for all tasks concerning studies, discipline and administration.
",
22687,The history of university reforms is almost as old as the universities themselves.,
22688,"In the center of the often controversially led arguments that accompanied and shaped reform processesstands the question of goals and purposes of universities, their role in society and their relationship to the state.",
22689,An often used witticism suggests that a university reform is like relocating a graveyard – one cannot expect the people concerned to contribute anything.,
22690,"Contrary to this, however, members of the faculty and the student body did indeed contribute to the discussions, raised demands and brought suggestions.",
22691,"Considering the historically grown identity of a centuries-old institution, it is no wonder that questions that touch upon this identity bring forth controversial standpoints which sometimes could be interpreted as defiance.",
22692,"For decades, Austrian universities were shaped by the reforms of the 19th century.",
22693,At the end of the 20th century a new dynamic set in that led to radical restructuring under the banner of university autonomy with the Universitätsgesetz (university law) of 2002.,
22694,"For more than 80 years, with the exception of the Nazi era, the structures of the Austrian universities were shaped by the 1873 law on the organization of academic authorities (OG 1873).",
22695,It had replaced the provisional organization law of 1849 and abolished the last remnants of the medieval corporation constitution with the removal of the faculty-doctorate councils from the university organization.,
22696,The conversion into a “university of tenured professors” started after 1848 thus became definitive.,
22697,Until 1975 the leadership of the universities lay almost exclusively with the professors.,
22698,"However, the universities still were state institutions with a restricted autonomous area of competence.",
22699,"The OG 1873 represented electoral and operational rules for the academic authorities, which had not brought many innovations compared to the provisional organization law of 1849.",
22700,It formed a basic university law which in the decades to follow led to an increasingly overwhelming number of ministerial provisions and decrees.,
22701,"A replacement was only implemented in 1955 with the Hochschulorganisationsgesetz (university organization law, HOG), which consolidated the many separate decrees into one legislative text.",
22702,"The goal of the Ministry of Education led by the ÖVP and of some members of the faculty was not a complete reform of the university system, but a consolidation of the legal regulations with a strong restorative tendency.",
22703,The professors’ leading role remained intact.,
22704,"Furthermore, the HOG 1955 clarified the distinction between the state’s and the autonomous university’s spheres of action and the categories in the teaching staff, as well as creating uniform academic terminology and establishing a legal basis for the Rectors’ Conference.",
22705,"The 1975 Universitätsorganisationsgesetz (university organization law, UOG) enacted under Minister of Science Hertha Firnberg in the socialist one-party government was the most impactful legal measure since 1849 up to that point.",
22706,It embraced the demands of students and the non-professorial teaching staff from the 1960s for participation at the universities.,
22707,Against the opposition of many professors these groups now received participation rights.,
22708,"In the university bodies (senate, faculties, institutes) the professors’ council was joined by councils of assistants and lecturers, students and general university personnel, who now were involved in decision-making processes.",
22709,This led to a significant change in the administrational structure.,
22710,The newly founded university directorate became the ministry’s “long arm”.,
22711,The faculty structure in place since the Middle Ages (with the addition of the Faculty of Protestant theology in 1922) was expanded: the five existing faculties became eight through the division of the Faculty of Law and Political Science and the Faculty of Philosophy.,
22712,"The demand for a “democratization of the universities” led to a university based on committees, in which decision-making processes were often lengthy.",
22713,"While the administrational structure had been modernized, the universities still remained state institutions with both autonomous and assigned tasks.",
22714,Possibilities for independent changes remained few within this framework.,
22715,"In the 1970s the university had opened up towards society, but the state-controlled and restricted autonomy was increasingly criticized.",
22716,"The quickly changing study conditions of a mass university and demands from the spheres of economy and politics, who understood the universities as a motor of economic development, led to intensified reform efforts beginning in the 1980s.",
22717,"Among other things, outdated and unwieldy leadership structures and the lack of scientific focus were criticized.",
22718,"The 1999 UOG, implemented at the University of Vienna in 2000, made the first steps towards deregulation and autonomization, but remained a transitional law.",
22719,"The Universitätsgesetz of 2002 (university law, UG, in effect from January 1, 2004) achieved a complete organizational restructuring.",
22720,The university’s legal status changed fundamentally: A part legally responsible institute of the state became a fully responsible legal entity under public law with full legal capacity.,
22721,"The university received control over the personnel and the budget, and the state constrained itself to legal supervision.",
22722,"A new institution was the university council, which is one of the highest administrative bodies next to the rectorate and the senate.",
22723,The Faculty of Medicine that had existed since the university’s foundation in 1365 was newly established as the Medical University of Vienna.,
22724,"Because of this reform, entrepreneurial principles became important for the university leadership.",
22725,The goal became to improve the universities’ ability to act in such a way that they could strategically design their tasks in research and teaching and constantly improve them.,
22726,"In keeping with the principles of public governance and New Public Management those tasks should no longer be implemented via state decrees, but instead on the basis of performance agreements between university and ministry, thus ensuring a flexible, performance- and quality-oriented autonomous approach.",
22727,"An intellectual capital statement by the university serves as an instrument for observation and control.
",
22728,In the Middle Ages and the early Modern Age income from foundations was an important source of capital for the university system.,
22729,"Teachers’ wages were paid, or at least augmented, with money from foundations, and scholarships and accommodations for students were provided.",
22730,"As long as the state did not allocate a university budget, the whole of the study system was dependent on these funds.",
22731,"Habsburg Landesfürsten (local sovereigns) as well as private persons acted as benefactors, contributing funds or realty to the foundation.",
22732,"They defined the objectives of their foundations, making them serve not only charitable causes, but also the memory or salvation of the donors.",
22733,Many of these foundations were administrated by the university or one of its faculties.,
22734,"Together with the All Saints’ chapter of St. Stephen’s cathedral which he had donated at the same time, the foundation was meant to serve the Duke’s salvation of his soul.",
22735,"However, Rudolf neglected to provide an adequate financial basis for the universitas magistrorum et scholarium (community of teachers and students).",
22736,"Although he allocated income from the Landesfürst’s parish at Laa an der Thaya to the university, it was not enough.",
22737,"His project of a separate university quarter (“Pfaffenstadt”, “priest city”) forever remained an idea.",
22738,"Rudolf’s brother, Albert III, who had already contributed to the university’s establishment in 1365, confirmed and renewed the Viennese university in 1384 and founded a magisters’ college, allotting it income and its own buildings.",
22739,"The Duke’s College (collegium ducale) which emerged from this, secured his college members – who were also entitled to a spot in the cathedral chapter – a regular income and gave the university its first own building in the Stubenviertel.",
22740,"Until it was handed over to the Jesuits in 1623, it was the university’s teaching and administration center.",
22741,"Albert III also donated other buildings for the formation of the collegium iuristarum (jurist school in Schulerstraße, 1384) and the St. Nicholas College for theologians (Singerstraße, 1385).",
22742,"Apart from charitable causes, an important motif of foundations in the Middle Ages, also of those for universities, was providing for one’s own salvation in the afterlife.",
22743,A foundation’s beneficiaries were obliged to serve the benefactor’s memoria mainly through prayer.,
22744,This also applied to students who received accommodations in bursae founded with this in mind.,
22745,"If the beneficiaries were poor people or people in need, the value of this pious deed was increased.",
22746,"From the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century, the thought of the afterlife retreated as a motivation for foundations.",
22747,The charitable foundations were then sometimes meant to support the studies of the benefactor’s family members or of people from their home regions.,
22748,Between 1365 and 1700 32 private scholarship foundations were established at the University of Vienna.,
22749,But also after this time it was common to promote one’s own memory through scholarships.,
22750,At the start of the 20th century more than 130 foundations were managed by the University of Vienna.,
22751,"Unfortunately however, much of the foundation funds fell victim to the hyperinflation of the 1920s.",
22752,"Due to the loss of capital, in 1926 most of them were consolidated into one scholarship fund.",
22753,As early as the 16th century the state took recourse to parts of the university’s assets from foundations.,
22754,This was justified with the increasing negligence in the scholarship and foundation system.,
22755,The administration of the university’s finances was handed over to the royal superintendent.,
22756,Since Ferdinand I’s Reformatio Nova in 1554 the professors’ wages were exclusively paid from the Landesfürst’s coffers.,
22757,Money the university received from legacies or by selling real estate had to be given as loans to the local sovereign’s treasury.,
22758,The university was supposed to meet expenses solely from the 10% interest rate.,
22759,"This led to problems, since the sovereign’s administration had a low payment morale.",
22760,"Until the middle of the 18th century, the university accrued over half a million guilders in outstanding claims to the state.",
22761,The state solved this problem in 1754 by simply nationalizing the entire wealth of the university.,
22762,All borrowers’ notes were handed over to the government.,
22763,"Thus, all relations under private law between the university and the state ended and in their place stepped a financial relationship subject to public law.",
22764,"At least the university had received a new building from Maria Theresia in 1755 – the so-called New Aula, today the seat of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",
22765,"However, in 1784, Emperor Joseph II brought it under control of the state’s financial administration, together with other real estate the university had partly gotten from foundations.",
22766,"With this, all of the university’s financial assets had been passed on to the state.
",
22767,“The university must constantly be reformed”.,
22768,"When looking at the various university organization laws of the past years, one might imagine this sentence to have been uttered in the context of the recent restructuring of the university system.",
22769,"In actual fact, it stems from the time of humanism, in which also many changes occurred in regard to administration and teaching at the University of Vienna.",
22770,Two main points of the reform movements have not changed over the centuries: the question of the university’s funding and closely related to this the state’s influence on the administration and teaching.,
22771,"The University of Vienna, which had been one of the most frequented universities north of the Alps until the start of the 16th century, experienced a dramatic decline in student numbers beginning in 1520.",
22772,With this recession also came a decline in the educational standard.,
22773,The reasons for this mostly lay in the propagation of humanistic and reformatory ideas.,
22774,"Although the Landesfürst (local sovereign) called humanists to Vienna, it proved difficult to integrate them into the university system.",
22775,The humanists regarded the topics that were taught and the methods used to do so as outdated and were more oriented towards the monarchy.,
22776,"A spiteful comment by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (the later Pope Pius II) about the Austrian theologian Thomas Ebendorfer is a good example for humanistic criticism of the late medieval teaching methods: Piccolomini said Ebendorfer was “a not unimportant theologian”, who had written “not unuseful historical works”, but he had been reading about the first chapter of the book of Isaiah for 22 years and had still not come to an end… Even though the humanists working in Vienna were hostile towards the university, there were some loose connections, mainly through the “Poetenkolleg” (“Poet College”), at which humanistic topics were taught.",
22777,The lectures held there were however not obligatory for the students at the Faculty of Arts.,
22778,The spread of Martin Luther’s theses were a much larger threat to the university.,
22779,He completely rejected universities as papal institutions.,
22780,"However, he revised his early general contempt for education and demanded that it should first and foremost serve the purpose of educating people about true Christianity.",
22781,Not least due to this it would also be in the interest of the (Protestant) authorities to expand and support the educational system.,
22782,"In the 16th century, many Protestant schools and universities were built in the Empire, entering into competition with the existing (Catholic) institutions.",
22783,"Particularly in Vienna, where students had overwhelmingly belonged to the “Rhenish nation” (South and South-West Germany) until the 16th century, this led to a massive drop in matriculation numbers.",
22784,Returning epidemics and the constant threat of the Ottomans also reduced Vienna’s appeal as a place of study.,
22785,"The decrease in students led to high losses of income for the university, which could not be balanced out by the insufficient allowances from the sovereign.",
22786,This loss of financial power amplified the university’s general plight and endangered its continued existence.,
22787,"Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who had ruled the Austrian hereditary lands since 1521, wanted to strengthen and expand the local sovereign’s power towards the estates.",
22788,In this context he – and the Protestant authorities – realized the importance of schools and universities as training centers for future officials and loyal subjects.,
22789,"To achieve this goal, on the one hand the educational standard had to be raised again to compete with the newly founded universities.",
22790,"On the other hand, reformatory ideology had to be prevented from being spread by way of education.",
22791,"The University of Vienna had already been infiltrated by Protestants as it was: While the Faculty of Theology de facto did not exist anymore due to the growing loss of members, Luther’s supporters represented a majority in the three worldly faculties.",
22792,"In 1524, they refused to write evaluations of Protestant texts.",
22793,"The jurists and physicians stated that this was not part of their duties, while the members of the Faculty of Arts argued that they could not evaluate books they were not allowed to read – after all, since 1520 it had been forbidden to read Luther’s works.",
22794,Radical reforms were necessary for the University of Vienna to be able to fulfill the duties bestowed upon it by the local sovereign: well-founded training for future officials based in Catholicism.,
22795,The first investigations in 1524 already showed that the insufficient financial funds were the university’s greatest problem.,
22796,A commission put in place by the Lower Austrian government suggested in 1528 to leave St. Ulrich monastery’s abandoned assets in Wiener Neustadt to the university and to have the prelate periodically collect money for it.,
22797,Due to the general political circumstances (siege of Vienna in 1529),
22798,"these suggestions were only picked up again a few years later, and were recorded in the so-called “First Reform Law” on August 2, 1533.",
22799,"Further measures to improve university finances were the review and expansion of the (private) scholarship system, which was put under the control of the royal superintendent.",
22800,He was supposed to inspect the bursae and scholarships at least once a year to remedy possible deficiencies.,
22801,The number of academic chairs was also reduced to enable higher salaries.,
22802,"In 1534 there was a crucial change in the university administration: Formerly, the university assembly had decided on important questions, but at that point the Consistory (originally a court assembly) became the central governing body of the university.",
22803,"Apart from the rector as head of the university and the officials from the faculties and nations (deans and procurators), the representatives of the bishop of Vienna and the Landesfürst – university chancellor and superintendent – received a seat in the Consistory.",
22804,Especially the superintendent’s position was upgraded.,
22805,"Nominally, he ranked behind the rector and the chancellor, but in fact he soon took on a leading role, since he managed the university’s finances.",
22806,As an official of the local sovereign he was first and foremost beholden to the ruler: He took his oath in front of him and was the sovereign’s “eyes and ears” in the university.,
22807,The curriculum was reorganized through the “Second Reform Law” of 1537.,
22808,"The number of salaried chairs, as well as the taught topics, was strictly regulated and the necessary lectures for each course of studies were restricted to the salaried chairs.",
22809,"Thus, the magisters who had been “freely lecturing” – mainly at the Faculty of Arts – became superfluous.",
22810,Another focus of the reforms was the re-Catholicization of the Viennese university.,
22811,"Apart from the regulations from the two reform laws, in 1536 the bursa conventors were instructed to check the orthodoxy of the students living in their bursae.",
22812,Graduates from the Protestant university in Wittenberg were barred from studying in Vienna.,
22813,In 1554 this ban was extended to all non-Catholic universities: Only students who had studied at Catholic universities were allowed to do a doctorate in Vienna.,
22814,"In 1548, conversely, Austrian subjects were prohibited from studying at foreign universities, with the exception of the university in Ingolstadt which was led by Jesuits.",
22815,"The verification of their orthodoxy was not only restricted to students, but was also expanded to the professors in 1546.",
22816,"Calling the Jesuit order to Vienna in 1551 was another important step of the Catholic reform – not only of the University of Vienna, but of the city’s whole educational system.",
22817,"In 1554, the laws regarding the university passed since the 1530s were summarized and recorded once more in the so-called “Reformatio Nova”.",
22818,The goals set by Ferdinand I for these reforms had only partially been reached.,
22819,"The measures to re-Catholicize the university can be seen as successful, although the measures decreed by Ferdinand in this regard were not implemented in practice by his successor Maximilian II, who was much more tolerant towards Protestantism: Protestants were able to study and do their doctorates in Vienna despite the aforementioned regulations.",
22820,"And yet, even though Maximilian tolerated Lutherans, he still wanted to preserve the “Roman-Catholic” character of the university.",
22821,"This mainly concerned religious duties of the university members, such as participation in the Corpus Christi procession which was rejected by the Protestants.",
22822,Under Rudolf II and Ferdinand II the anti-reformationist efforts were picked up again and led to a successful end.,
22823,Another success was the implementation of the local sovereign’s control over the university.,
22824,"Through the enhancement of the superintendent’s position, he became the ruler’s supervisory authority in the university.",
22825,"Improving the university’s financial situation was a failure, however.",
22826,"Although Ferdinand I allocated goods from abandoned monasteries and payments from offices of the Landesfürst to the university, it could only enforce these with difficulty, if at all – entertainingly, one of the offices supposed to give money to the university was the salt authority, which has become a proverbial place to lodge useless complaints.",
22827,Collecting the “prelate contribution” also only proceeded slowly and did not yield the expected sums.,
22828,"Due to these constant financial difficulties the university’s outstanding claims to the treasury mounted up to more than half a million guilders over the course of 200 years. 
",
22829,In 1897 women were first admitted to study at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Vienna.,
22830,"This was followed in 1900 by the Faculty of Medicine, 1919 the Faculty of Law, 1928 the Protestant theological Faculty and finally 1945 the Catholic theological Faculty.",
22831,"The first doctorate of a woman at the university in 1897 was that of the physician Gabriele Possanner von Ehrenthal, who had previously studied and graduated at the University of Zurich.",
22832,"After a letter to Emperor Franz Joseph in 1895, the Ministry of the Interior allowed her to nostrify her Swiss doctoral degree and thus to practice as a doctor.",
22833,The Romance philologist Elise Richter was the first woman to habilitate at the University of Vienna in 1907.,
22834,"In 1921, also as the first woman, she was awarded the title of associate professor.",
22835,The first full professorship was awarded to the physicist Berta Karlik in 1956.,
22836,"The fact that the first full professor was only appointed almost half a century after a woman was first qualified as a professor is also due to the influence of National Socialism, which had interrupted the development of many female pioneers.",
22837,"125 years after the admission of the first women to study at the University of Vienna, from March 8, 2022 on, the Gender Equality and Diversity unit of the University of Vienna presented the exhibition (No) Walk in the Park - 125 Years of Women at the University of Vienna in courtyard 1 of the Campus that showed that the history of women at the university is everything but a walk in the park.
",
22838,"If one is to believe contemporary complaints about the undisciplined behavior of students in the 15th and 16th centuries, their preferred activities were making noise, nightly loitering, binge drinking, violent confrontations with citizens, visiting “women’s houses” (the contemporary name for brothels), playing dice and chess, and other prohibited pastimes.",
22839,"All of this in provocative, fashionable clothing that ran counter to the regulations.",
22840,"The sources also include the swear words that were used to describe these undesirable people: “Fosse” (good-for-nothing, rascal, vagrant), or, more specifically, “Partekenfresser” (“Parteken eaters”; “Parteke” was the name for the piece of bread that was given to poor students as charity).",
22841,"These stereotypes were not only prevalent in Vienna, but in the whole European university world.",
22842,"They informed a distorted picture that did not necessarily correspond to reality, but did actually have a background in reality.",
22843,"In the University of Vienna’s records, kept by its officials (rectors, deans), there is mention of student “excesses”: brawls, riots, violations of dress regulations, carrying of weapons and similar offences.",
22844,Already at the establishment of the university in 1365 one had thought of the possibility of violent conflicts with citizens due to members of a privileged legal community – also including the students – living together.,
22845,Experiences from other university locations certainly played a role in this.,
22846,Punishments for murder and assault of university members depending on the severity of the case were determined in the deed of foundation.,
22847,It was also regulated who the judge would be: the university’s rector.,
22848,Magisters or scholars who seduced a woman were to lose all university privileges.,
22849,"In consequence, this punishment – expulsion from the university – was a measure carried out often, not only related to interaction with women.",
22850,"With this punishment, the people concerned, who often had come to study from abroad, lost the protection of the university and were at the mercy of the city’s authority, which often was not well-disposed to foreigners.",
22851,"A secluded men’s society, which the university was for centuries, almost inevitably brought conflict into the city, which could for example ignite in contact with the other gender.",
22852,"It probably was no coincidence that the largest Viennese student riot, the “Latin War” of 1513, started in front of a “women’s house”, a brothel.",
22853,"Their opponents were winemakers’ servants, with whom there had already been violent confrontations the century before.",
22854,Such incidents often ended with people dead or badly wounded.,
22855,"Other places where violent conflicts were carried out were taverns, baths and nighttime streets.",
22856,"Violent confrontations also occurred with other city residents, such as artisans.",
22857,"In 1454 there was a confrontation with butcher journeymen, who fought the students with bows, swords and other weapons.",
22858,"On another occasion castle mercenaries and followers of the royal captain in Austria, Wolfgang von Wallsee, were the opponents.",
22859,In 1460 members of the papal legate cardinal Bessarion’s retinue were attacked by students when he was visiting Vienna.,
22860,"It is no wonder that such cases also caused political and diplomatic turbulences which embarrassed the university’s officials, since they were the ones responsible for the students’ supervision and jurisdiction.",
22861,"In faculty statutes and bursae (student housing) regulations, clothing, lifestyle and daily life of the students were painstakingly governed.",
22862,"The relatively high student numbers at the University of Vienna in the 15th and early 16th century led to many students living in private accommodations, which were not regulated by the university.",
22863,"Constantly, the university was faced with criticism that they were not able to enforce their own rules.",
22864,"Indeed, the complaints about nighttime vagrancy, visits of taverns, baths and “women’s houses” are so prevalent in the university sources, that it seems the public and uncontrolled presence of students in the city was a common occurrence.",
22865,"The students concerned most often were scholars of the Faculty of Arts, who made up the majority of university members.",
22866,"They usually were slightly younger than today’s students, often between the ages of 14 and 16.",
22867,"Thus, the repeated confrontations with other, often also young, city residents can also be seen in the context of a late medieval and early Modern youth culture, in which violent conflicts between rivaling groups of adolescents was not uncommon.
",
22868,A large part of students as well as some professors and doctors of the University of Vienna were important protagonists in the revolution of 1848.,
22869,"Their goals were civil participation in political power and the realization of political reforms in line with the principles of freedom, democracy, religious tolerance and national unity.",
22870,"In March 1848, the poet and physician Ludwig August Frankl celebrated the revolutionaries’ first successes with his poem “The University” – printed as “first censorship-free paper”, written with the pathos typical for that time: “What approaches with bold strides?",

22880,Microbes - aren\t they the invisible pathogens that live in the dirt?,
22881,"In the early 2000s, microbiologists began using new technologies to analyse the microbes that live in, on and all around us – and were surprised by the huge number and diversity of organisms they found, explains David Berry, who studies the gut microbiome at the Department of Microbiology and Ecosystem Science.",
22882,"For Berry, two key facts about microbes – a collective term for a wide variety of microscopically small life forms from the domains of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes – stand out:",
22883,"First, they are many and they are everywhere.",
22884,There are more microbial cells in and on the human body than human cells.,
22885,There is hardly a surface that is not covered by them.,
22886,And: Most microbes are completely harmless to useful.,
22887,"Pathogens, i.e., disease-causing agents, are strongly in the minority.",
22888,Bacteria in particular used to be considered the bad guys.,
22889,"With increasing research into the microbiome since the early 2000s, it has been recognised that many bacteria are actually necessary for the healthy development and functioning of the body.",
22890,", We are born sterile, but in the first two weeks we pick up microbes, through birth as well as from the environment, from other people, animals, from surfaces.",
22891,"Our microbiome continues to be influenced by breast milk, baby milk and by solid food later on, Berry explains.",
22892,"In this way, each person develops an individual \microbial fingerprint\ in the course of the first two years of life.",
22893,"Berry uses the example of extreme pre-term births to illustrate the importance of the developing microbiome, The composition of the microbiome one month after a preterm birth is predictive for cognitive and social functions two years later.",
22894,"In adults, too, a change in the microbiome can be observed in neurodegenerative diseases and even in depression.",
22895,"In animal models, this connection could be studied more clearly.",
22896,There are strains of mice that are characterised by their shy behaviour and those that are very curious.,
22897,"If you exchange their gut microbiome, the shy mice will become curious and the curious ones shy, Berry describes his \favourite experiment\.",
22898,"The microbial phenotype has an influence on behaviour, Berry is fascinated.",
22899,"In microbiome research, this connection is called the gut-microbiome-brain axis and research into the mechanisms behind it is currently a hot topic in the field.",
22900,"Microbiologists like Berry consider the immune system a likely mediator., After a PhD in Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan, he moved to the Department of Microbiology and Ecosystem Science at the University of Vienna in 2009.",
22901,He is a member of the scientific advisory board of the Austrian Microbiome Initiative AMICI and on the board of directors of the Joint Microbiome Facility (JMF) of the University of Vienna and the Medical University of Vienna.,
22902,"As the view of bacteria has changed, so has the way microbiologists view the immune system.",
22903,"Berry explains, What was previously seen as a sentry or killing system of intruders, we now see as a gardener, keeping a balance between the function of the microbes and the body.",
22904,"And finally, the concept of \pathogens\ (disease-causing agents) has also undergone a transformation in this context, the microbiologist says.",
22905,"Where a wide variety of microbes have a place in our body\s garden, pathogens are often simply opportunists that become dangerous under certain circumstances (of the immune system) but are harmless in other situations, he says.",
22906,Berry mentions Clostridioides difficile as an example.,
22907,"This so-called \hospital germ\ is the cause of an infection called CDI, a recurring and serious diarrhoeal disease.",
22908,"However, many babies in particular have the bacterium in their intestines and do not show any illness, says the microbiologist.",
22909,The important thing is how CDI occurs: Most patients contract CDI after being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.,
22910,"Broad-spectrum antibiotics destroy not only \pathogens\ but also the beneficial microbiome, which also plays a protective role.",
22911,"Because in an \empty house\ C. diff. can spread much better than in an already well-populated one, says Berry.",
22912,"Thus, the microbiome is central to the health of our body – ranging from the protection against the spread of individual bacteria to our brain function.",
22913,"Therefore, microbiologists developed the idea of treating patients having a dysfunctional microbiome by transplanting a healthy microbiome.",
22914,"This treatment, known as fecal microbiota transplant’, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 and has been used successfully under very strict conditions since then, including meticulous screening and cleaning precautions and rare side effects.",
22915,", However, Berry warns against an unqualified generalisation of the idea that people should increase their exposure to the microbiome of others, As late as the 19th century, there were still rampant typhoid and cholera epidemics in the US and Europe, caused largely by the exchange of faeces via contaminants, especially in the water.",
22916,"In the early 20th century, drinking water was chlorinated and with that, these incidents also dropped tremendously.",
22917,We should keep this in mind when people say that our modern way of life is \over-sterilised\ and romanticise a more \original\ lifestyle.,
22918,But all this raises a new question: What actually is a healthy microbiome?,
22919,"Because: Against the backdrop of the individual interactions between the body and the microbiome, it can be possible that a certain microbial composition works well in one person, but leads to illness in another, Berry explains the problem.",
22920,"This, however, is above all an opportunity for personalised medicine.",
22921,"Berry says, If we better understood the interactions between the body and the microbiome, we could tell which microbes are helpful or harmful in a given situation by looking at a patient\s genetic profile.",
22922,"But when it comes to controlling the gut microbiome in a particular way, new tools are needed.",
22923,"As we already know, antibiotics – as necessary as they sometimes are – also have the potential to cause great damage to the microbiome through their undifferentiated effect.",
22924,"Berry sees the so-called \phage therapy\ as a promising new approach, Phages are viruses that infect bacteria.",
22925,"They are so specific that they can attack individual bacterial strains, giving us the opportunity to really fine-tune the microbiome.",
22926,"Berry sees the potential of phage therapy not only where antibiotics are causing too much damage, but also where antibiotics can no longer do any good, i.e. in case of multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria.",
22927,"With multi-resistant pathogens, the circle is closed with the environment that is in us and the one that surrounds us.",
22928,"These super bugs develop when bacteria that are exposed to antibiotics enter nature through our waste water and, above all, livestock farming., Berry traces the causal chain, The bacteria that are already potential human pathogens now come into contact with bacterial communities in the soil that have resistance genes for these antibiotics.",
22929,"And because of the strong selective pressure exerted by the huge quantities of antibiotics, it is advantageous for the potential pathogens to acquire the resistances and also pass them on – until they eventually reach humans again.",
22930,"And this also brings together two areas of research that have traditionally been studied separately: \red\ microbiology, which deals with medically relevant mechanisms and methods, and \green\ microbiology, which focusses on the environment.",
22931,This is also the basic idea in our new Cluster of Excellence \Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health\ explains the microbiologist.,
22932,We want to look at the microbiome more holistically and integrate the mechanisms of action of the individual aspects as well as the methods of the different disciplines.,
22933,"No matter whether it is inside us or around us, the health of the microbial environment is essential for human health.",

22936,"Data Protection Declaration People who try to do the right thing for the environment such as vegans, \Zero Wasters\ or activists are often disliked.",
22937,"People tend to see them as preachy, militant and annoying, says Jana Köhler, doctoral candidate at the Vienna Doctoral School in Cognition, Behaviour and Neuroscience (VDS CoBeNe).",
22938,"To promote individual behaviour as an important component of climate action, these behaviours need to be socially rewarded and not punished.",
22939,"I am interested to see whether these negative stereotypes keep others from doing the same behaviours because they do not want to be seen in the same negative way, Jana Köhler explains.",
22940,"Since 2020, the Vienna Doctoral Schools have provided excellent services, including team supervision and various funding possibilities, to enable competitive research at an international scale.",
22941,"In the doctoral schools, doctoral candidates enjoy an active and inspiring research environment, a vibrant doctoral community and many ways to connect with peers from home and abroad at both social and professional levels.",
22942,The young scientist studies the impact of social punishments on environmentalists’ motivation and wellbeing as well as the appeal of environmentally- and climate-friendly behaviour to the general public.,
22943,"We can only have a healthy planet and healthy people if we start protecting the climate and the environment, Jana Köhler emphasises.",
22944,"By investigating human experiences and behaviours, she is making important contributions to her discipline Environmental Psychology, which falls under the behavioural sciences.",
22945,"The nice thing about my research is that there is not much of a daily routine, Köhler says.",
22946,She has a very diverse set of tasks:,
22947,"So when I am doing data collection, I do in-person or virtual interviews with research participants and when I am doing data analysis, I run a lot of statistical tests.",
22948,"And then I am preparing my results for scientific conferences, which means that I am creating posters and presentations to communicate my research.",
22949,"For one of her studies, she interviews vegans and those who refuse to fly for the sake of the environment.",
22950,"Both of those groups experience conflict and fighting with their family as a consequence of their behaviour, Köhler says.",
22951,"However, over time most of them overcome these conflicts because they develop understanding and empathy for each other.",
22952,That makes her hopeful that we can stand united to create a more just and healthier planet for all.,
22953,I chose to do my PhD at the University of Vienna because it is one of the few European Universities that has an Environmental Psychology research group.,
22954,My supervisors are internationally renowned with unique expertise in their field.,
22955,"We have since created a group with a diverse expertise in a nurturing working environment, Köhler says.
",
22956,The elusive tri-coloured European hamster is normally difficult to spot.,
22957,"Yet these critically endangered critters are surprisingly at ease in the Vienna Central Cemetery, frolicking openly between tombstones and visitors.",
22958,"We have a lot of sightings where hamsters try to steal a candle from a grave and try to push it in the burrows, says Thomas Filek in an interview with wildlife filmmaker Hannah Stitfall at BBC Earth, they can eat it because it’s a source of fat and they can digest it, explains the paleontologist at the University of Vienna.",
22959,The Vienna Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof) is a bucket-list destination thanks to its famous historical residents and unique architecture.,
22960,"One of Viennas best-kept secrets, however, is that it is also a hotspot for wildlife watching.",
22961,"A place of tranquillity and remembrance for the dead, the old cemetery has become a sanctuary for life — many creatures, including those endangered and at risk, are able to thrive in densely populated urban areas because of the quiet oasis.",
22962,"Some have adapted to unique features of this environment, like the wild hamsters and their candles., Foxes, deer, hamsters, numerous bird and insect species.",
22963,"The list of animal cemetery inhabitants in Vienna is long, explains Thomas Filek.",
22964,"Together with palaeontologist Doris Nagel, he coordinates the citizen science project Biodiversity at the Cemeteries (Biodiversität am Friedhof, BaF), which is funded by the City of Vienna as well as the Wiener Friedhöfe GmbH.",
22965,"To uncover the actual biological biodiversity of Vienna\s network of cemeteries, the project team relies on the support of visitors as citizen scientists to map out a comprehensive picture of species diversity.",
22966,"In the last two years, citizen scientists and project researchers have collectively documented a dozen species of mammals, nearly 80 types of birds, and altogether hundreds of reptiles, amphibians, snails, and insect species in 46 cemeteries across 497 hectares.",
22967,"We now know that there are more than 300 different species of plants, says Filek, referring to the diverse vegetation cradling Vienna\s eternal resting places.",
22968,"The cemetery staff can report sightings from time to time, but only when visitors participate over the course of a year can we really generate a comprehensive database,says Doris Nagel, for instance, of migratory birds.",
22969,"Members of the public, especially the expert birders of Vienna, have responded enthusiastically to the project, sending photos and sighting forms by e-mail or through the Wildtiere app run by cooperation partner Urban Wild Animals at Stadtwildtiere.at.",
22970,Anyone can participate in scientific research by working with scientists on citizen science projects.,
22971,"These are projects that rely on public participants to crowd-source, collect, or analyze new data.",
22972,"In more participatory projects, non-scientists can even help define and develop the research questions.",
22973,“Biodiversity at the Cemeteries is one of the citizen science projects at University of Vienna.,
22974,"Schools are also cooperating with the scientists to document biodiversity in their nearby cemeteries, reports Thomas Filek, the project tries to motivate young people to engage with science through citizen science research.",
22975,Students can engage in a range of scientific methods in the field and thus become immersed in the process of biological research.,
22976,"Some of these skills include mapping, collecting, measuring, documenting, photographing and data analysis, according to Filek, Nagel as well as colleagues Viktoria Frey and Richard Zink at the Konrad Lorenz Institute of University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna.",
22977,"The aim is to obtain a comprehensive overview of the biological diversity on Viennese cemeteries, explains Thomas Filek.",
22978,"Only then can we assess whether these oases of tranquillity are not just a last retreat for species in the city, but also corridors within a network of increasingly fragmented nature.",
22979,Cemeteries are important microhabitats in urban areas.,
22980,"They are stepping stone biotopes that provide a bridge between habitats, especially for the lower vertebrates, insects and molluscs.",
22981,"To map out a network of nature in urban environments, the researchers are also documenting creatures that are generally overlooked, such as fungi, and encourage participants to record remnants such as animal faeces and hair.",
22982,"Filek and his team are supported by Wiener Friedhöfe GmbH, a committed partner managing 46 of the 55 cemeteries in Vienna.",
22983,They are currently planning an outdoor exhibition of sighting reports with images taken by their photographers and citizen scientists.,
22984,High-resolution photos of cemetery wildlife are also available for purchase as a perpetual wall calendar: Hidden Life at the Cemetery (Verborgenes Leben am Friedhof).,
22985,More images and reports of new findings can be found on the project’s Instagram and Facebook accounts.,
22986,They are excited about the next steps.,
22987,"We are planning a larger project on animals at night, to see how animals live in the dark.",
22988,"They are also interested in zooming in on the microcosm, to focus more on insects and plants.",

",
22991,"We live in a time of crisis today, a period of polycrisis, as economic historian Adam Tooze coined it.",
22992,"The ramifications of the lingering pandemic, war, soaring energy prices, the climate crisis, and the deepening of economic inequalities are intertwined and affect societies around the world.",
22993,Considering such events solely as momentary flare-ups in history overlooks their enduring impacts on society – we should consider them in the context of their long-term consequences.,
22994,How can we comprehend the lived experiences of individuals during times of crisis and the durable inequalities they bring about?,
22995,"In this regard, the post-1989 period in Central Eastern Europe presents rich lessons for current times.",
22996,"In countries that underwent the breakdown of state socialism, the social inequalities resulting from rapid deindustrialization, labour market crises, the revaluation of skills, and high inflation in the early 1990s deeply entrenched themselves, shaping peoples life chances for decades to follow.,",
22997,"In my new book Deserved, I sought to analyse the main narratives that emerge when people remember the 1990s in Central Eastern Europe today.",
22998,"Major crises generate a dichotomy of winners and losers, a pattern of social and moral categorization that people must grapple with.",
22999,"Who deserves what, and why?",
23000,Interviews with engineers and care workers uncovered that people find themselves fervently discussing and pondering questions of inequality and its long-term effects when trying to make sense of these processes.,
23001,"From a social science perspective, we know that a persons age, gender, ethnicity, qualifications, and location at the time of the crisis all fundamentally ingrained themselves into socioeconomic trajectories.",
23002,Robust welfare systems can effectively cushion such shocks and mitigate their effects.,
23003,"Therefore, trust in public responses emerges as a crucial factor, which was notoriously low in many Central Eastern European societies.",
23004,", However, even though the power of circumstances is beyond individual control, individuals with first-hand experience of the post-1989 changes form a vivid moral imagination about it.",
23005,"People may actively employ a winner versus loser language on others, yet simultaneously strive to distance themselves from the stigmatizing consequences when it pertains to their own life choices.",
23006,The way individuals ask and respond to questions of deservingness shapes their overarching narrative of economic transformation.,
23007,They ask: What economic choices were available to individuals once the Iron Curtain came down?,
23008,"If a person became unemployed in the wave of mass layoffs of the time, they wonder, did he or she really try hard enough to escape economic hardship?",
23009,"People may hold the meritocratic belief that it was personal effort or a commitment to hard work that made the difference, or they may attribute it to factors such as health or psychological circumstances, thereby presenting a more structural explanation.",
23010,"Alternatively, they may perceive it as largely reliant on luck.",
23011,These narratives matter because they influence the degree of inequality that individuals are willing to tolerate in the present.,
23012,"As numerous studies on welfare attitudes have revealed – not just in the Central Eastern European context –, the way people attribute agency significantly influences their perceptions of the states role in redistributing resources to those who are less-well off.",
23013,",",
23014,"For example, if someone strongly believes that another persons inability to overcome a period of joblessness stems from laziness or a lack of seriousness, they will be much less inclined to feel a sense of solidarity.",
23015,"Consequently, they may also deem them as undeserving of state support.",
23016,", These issues also profoundly affect the everyday perception of friendship bonds.",
23017,"This is a space where individuals articulate their core values, as it is grounded in the lived experience of egalitarian relationships.",
23018,"The post-1989 era and the divergent outcomes of social mobility have given rise to stark material disparities among individuals who were once more equal, thereby challenging notions of equality within ones immediate social circles.",
23019,", Philosopher Avishai Margalit suggested that friendship ties are thick because they are built upon a shared understanding of the relationship\s history.",
23020,"This makes it difficult, however, to sustain a sense of equality when material circumstances diverge.",
23021,"When remembering the disruptive changes of the 1990s, people evaluate the economic agency of their current friends as well as of those from whom they have severed ties or distanced themselves, thereby creating an unsettling nexus between the notion of economic deservingness and their innermost social circles.",
23022,"To conclude, the concern with individual responsibility for economic outcomes is a major reason for why, in welfare societies, ideas about who deserves what, and why are so salient in the wake of major crisis experiences.",
23023,We should be mindful about how we come to judge the polycrises of our times.,
23024,"For instance, we can observe similar patterns in the way the economic ramifications of the pandemic are perceived – think of the example of the large-scale programs of pandemic state relief, which were publicly discussed in terms of legitimacy, in terms of who has a right to be saved from economic distress or bankruptcy –, as well as in the unfolding energy crisis, which entails a profound and arguably enduring material shock for a considerable number of people.",
23025,Till Hilmar\s new book—Deserved: Economic Memories After the Fall of the Iron Curtain— is coming out in July 2023 at Columbia University Press.,
23026,Deserved investigates the moral imagination of economic change in the aftermath of the breakdown of communism in Eastern Europe.,
23027,The memories of the post-1989 transformations also direct our focus towards the variation in national memories that shape the interpretation of long-term economic ruptures.,
23028,"While neoliberal transformation was considered a Czech success story, the predominating East German narrative is of being marginalized as second-class citizens.",
23029,We may also be able to observe analogous differences in the varying ways causes and responsibilities for the decarbonisation of European economies are publicly communicated by political and economic stakeholders today.,
23030,"Finally, if we truly wish to comprehend people\s experience during times of crisis, we must abandon the idea that these experiences exist solely at the individual level, something that we may currently observe in an upsurge of psychologically informed discourse about individual resilience.",
23031,"In fact, people navigate crises as interconnected subjects within a web of social relationships such as friendship ties.",
23032,Their ideas about the moral and inequality-related implications of crises experiences are moulded within these networks.,
23033,"Therefore, their memories and their long-term narratives about them are deeply influenced by these very social connections.",
23034,"The Research Centre for the History of Transformations (RECET) at University of Vienna is hosting their second History and Social Sciences Festival Transformations of (In)Equality from 24-26 May, 2023.",
